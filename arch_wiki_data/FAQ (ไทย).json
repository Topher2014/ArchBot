Many thousands of volunteered hours have been spent compiling this excellent information.\n\nSee also Arch terminology#RTFM and the Installation guide.\n\n"

Arch targets competent users who enjoy its 'do-it-yourself' nature, and who further exploit it to shape the system to fit their unique needs. Therefore, in the hands of its target user base, Arch can be used for virtually any purpose. Many use Arch on both their desktops and workstations. And of course, archlinux.org, aur.archlinux.org and almost all of Arch's infrastructure runs on Arch.\n\n"

If the user reaches out to the community, help is often provided in a timely manner. The difference between Arch and other distributions in this regard is that Arch is truly a 'do-it-yourself' distribution; complaints of breakage are misguided and unproductive, since upstream changes are not the responsibility of Arch devs.\n\nSee the System maintenance article for tips on how to make an Arch Linux system as stable as possible.\n\n"

For advanced setups, you may also want to look at traffic shaping.\n\nOne of the most commonly used kernels, linux, tends to be newer than the kernel of other, more stable, Linux distributions. Because of that, you may rarely experience a kernel regression or driver bug, especially if using Wi-Fi. Do note that the vast majority of those bugs are not Arch Linux-specific as Arch Linux only applies the most basic of patches. This needs to be taken upstream. See #I have found an error with package X. What should I do?.\n\n"

      "title": "Why is Arch using all my RAM?",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Essentially, unused RAM is wasted RAM.\n\nMany new users notice how the Linux kernel handles memory differently than they are used to. Since accessing data from RAM is much faster than from a storage drive, the kernel caches recently accessed data in memory. The cached data is only cleared when the system begins to run out of available memory and new data needs to be loaded.\n\nWe could distinguish the difference from free command:\n\n```\n$ free -h\n```\n\n```\ntotal        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:          2.8Gi       1.1Gi       283Mi       224Mi       1.4Gi       1.2Gi\nSwap:         3.0Gi       881Mi       2.1Gi\n```\n\nIt is important to note the difference between \"free\" and \"available\" memory. In the above example, a laptop with 2.8 GiB of total RAM appears to be using most of it, with only 283 MiB as free memory. However, 1.4 GiB of it is \"buff/cache\". There is still 1.2 GiB available for starting new applications, without swapping. See free(1) for details. The result of all this? Performance!\n\nSee this wonderful article if your curiosity has been piqued. There is also a website dedicated to clearing this confusion: https://www.linuxatemyram.com/.\n\n"

Often it is not (e.g. Firefox crashes may be the fault of the Mozilla team); this is called an upstream error, see Bug reporting guidelines#Upstream or Arch?. If it is an Arch problem, there is a series of steps you can take:\n\n1. Search the forums for information. See if anyone else has noticed it.\n1. Post a bug report with detailed information on the Arch Linux bug tracker in Gitlab.\n1. If you would like, write a forum post detailing the problem and the fact that you have reported it already.

In this way it is possible to have applications compiled against different versions of libfoo installed on the same system.\n\nIn case of a distribution like Arch, only the latest packaged versions are officially supported. By dropping support for outdated software, package maintainers are able to spend more time ensuring that the newest versions work as expected. As soon as a new version of a shared library becomes available from upstream, it is added to the repositories and affected packages are rebuilt to use the new version.\n\n"

Assuming an application called foobaz is in one of the official repositories and builds successfully against a new version of a shared library called libbaz, it will be updated along with libbaz. If, however, it does not build successfully, foobaz package will have a versioned dependency (e.g. libbaz 1.5), and will be removed by pacman during libbaz upgrade, due to a conflict.\n\nIf foobaz is a package that you built yourself and installed from AUR, you should rebuild foobaz against the new version of libbaz.

The specific amount of time can be as short as a few hours after upstream releases a minor bugfix update to as long as several weeks after a large package group's major update. The amount of time from an upstream's new version to Arch releasing a new package depends on the specific packages and the availability of the package maintainers. Additionally, some packages spend some time in the testing repository, so this can prolong the time before a package is updated. Package maintainers attempt to work quickly to bring stable updates to the repositories.

Regardless, it is not a proper solution, because:\n\n- Libraries do not change versions randomly – the API/ABI will have likely changed (possibly with bits removed), and whether those changes affect the usage is just a matter of luck.\n- The symlink would be untracked by a package manager. Beginners who immediately try to hack on system library files are in the greatest risk of making an unwanted change that they cannot diagnose/fix, which a package manager helps to guard against.\n- A slight alternative of dumping the old library file into the filesystem, untracked, would be forgotten about, and not have potential security bugs noticed/patched.\n\nInstead, e.g. use/write a compat (compatibility) package, which provides the required library version.\n\n"

If your computer has more than 4 GiB of RAM, only a 64-bit OS will be able to fully utilize it.\n\nProgrammers also increasingly tend to care less about 32-bit (\"legacy\") as \"new\" x86 CPUs typically support the 64-bit extensions.\n\nThere are many more reasons we could list here to tell you to avoid 32-bit, but between the kernel, userspace and individual programs it is simply not viable to list every last thing that 64-bit does much better these days.\n\n"
