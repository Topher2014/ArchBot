      "level": 3,
      "content": "A number of common layout types appear in several tiling WMs, although the terminology varies somewhat.\n\n- max: one window shown fullscreen (with or without a status bar, title and borders). Aka: monocle (dwm, monsterwm).\n- h-stack: master area in top half, other windows stack up horizontally in the bottom half. The master area may be resizable. May be inverted top-bottom (wmfs). Aka: bottom stack (dwm), bstack(monsterwm).\n- v-stack: master area in left half, other windows stack up vertically in the right half. The master area may be resizable. May be inverted left-right (wmfs). Aka: tile (dwm, monsterwm).\n- nh-stack: h-stack allowing >=1 windows in master area. Aka: nbstack (dwm)\n- nv-stack: v-stack allowing >=1 windows in master area. Aka: ntile (dwm)\n- mirror-h: nh-stack with stacks above and below the master area\n- mirror-v: nv-stack with stacks to the left and right of the master area\n- h-tab: one window shown fullscreen with all window titles shown horizontally (like browser tabs)\n- v-tab: one window shown fullscreen with all window titles shown vertically. Aka: stack (wmii).\n- h-split: a keybinding splits the current window horizontally creating space for another\n- v-split: a keybinding splits the current window vertically creating space for another\n- columns: manual layout style which treats windows as belonging to vertical columns\n- rows: manual layout style which treats windows as belonging to horizontal rows\n- grid: window positions and sizes based on a regular NxM grid. May be automatic (like wmfs, monsterwm) or manual (like Subtle).\n\n"

Some default sets are better than others, but generally the keys can be rebound as desired by the user.\n\n"
