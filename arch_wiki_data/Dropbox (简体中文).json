The service then attempts to hand over control to this binary and dies, causing systemd to re-start the service, generating a conflict and an endless loop of log-filling, CPU-eating misery.\n\nA workaround is to prevent Dropbox from downloading the automatic update by creating the ~/.dropbox-dist/ folder and making it read-only:\n\n```\n$ rm -rf ~/.dropbox-dist\n$ install -dm0 ~/.dropbox-dist\n```\n\nThis appears to be necessary for modern Dropbox clients to operate successfully from systemd on arch.\n\nAlso see the relevant Dropbox forum post.\n\n"

Starting Dropbox with systemd works, running in background, but there is no icon on systray due to some Cinnamon bugs (#481, #2846).\n\nIf that does not work, you can start the Dropbox sync client along with your window manager by adding /usr/bin/dropbox & to your xinitrc (or ~/.config/openbox/autostart, depending on your setup).\n\n"

You can also mount an encrypted volume at startup using the -S option of encfs to avoid having to input the passphrase, but note that your encrypted files are not secure from someone who has direct access to your computer.\n- A third option is to use gocryptfs. It is similar to EncFS, except that gocryptfs uses authenticated encryption, for protecting both confidentiality and integrity (tamper-resistance) of the data.\n\nSee also Data-at-rest encryption#Cloud-storage optimized.\n\n"

The best solution to this problem, for wired and wireless connections, is #Dropbox on laptops which will ensure that Dropbox is started only after the connection is established.\n\nAn alternative solution, for those not using netctl or NetworkManager, is to delay the startup of Dropbox:\n\n- cp ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop ~/.config/autostart/dropbox-delayed.desktop\n- Prevent Dropbox from doing a standard autostart by unchecking Dropbox - Preferences - General - Start Dropbox on system startup. This removes ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop.\n- Edit ~/.config/autostart/dropbox-delayed.desktop and replace Exec=dropbox with Exec=bash -c \"sleep timeout && dropbox\". Tweak the timeout parameter, the value of 3 is a good start.\n\nAnother possibility is that Arch Linux by default updates to and installs dbus-broker, reverting to dbus-daemon-units will fix this, Dropbox seems to not support dbus-broker.\n\n"
