Therefore, you must first remove them from the bootable entries to regain access to the BIOS, then manually mark these files as being safe.\n\nThe exact process will depend on your installation. For example:\n\n1. Start Arch from a bootable USB.\n1. Use the efibootmgr command to remove the non-verified entries.\n1. Reboot and try to access the BIOS (by pressing F2). It should now work.\n1. If available, enable the F12 Boot Menu option (to use as a fallback next time).\n1. Enable Secure Boot and set a Supervisor Password.\n1. Select and mark the .efi files as trusted for execution.\n1. Disable Secure Boot and remove the Supervisor Password.\n1. Reboot and re-enter the BIOS to set up again the appropriate boot priority order.\n\nAt that point, both the Linux bootloader and the Acer BIOS should be accessible without issues.\n\n"
