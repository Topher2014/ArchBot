If for some reason it is not mapped to mod4, use xmodmap to find out what is. To change the mapping, use xev to find the keycode and name of the key to be mapped. Then add something like the following to ~/.xinitrc\n\n```\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 115 = Super_L\" -e \"add mod4 = Super_L\"\nexec awesome\n```\n\nThe problem in this case is that some xorg installations recognize keycode 115, but incorrectly as the 'Select' key. The above command explictly remaps keycode 115 to the correct 'Super_L' key.\n\nTo remap mod4 with setxkbmap (conflict with xmodmap) see:\n\n```\ntail -50 /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev\n```\n\nTo set the caps lock key as mod4 add the following to ~/.xinitrc:\n\n```\nsetxkbmap -option caps:hyper\n```\n\n"
