      "title": "Rounding",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Since many partitioning systems have complicated constraints, Parted will usually do something slightly different to what you asked. (For example, create a partition starting at 10.352Mb, not 10.4Mb) If the calculated values differ too much, Parted will ask you for confirmation. If you know exactly what you want, or to see exactly what Parted is doing, it helps to specify partition endpoints in sectors (with the \"s\" suffix) and give the \"unit s\" command so that the partition endpoints are displayed in sectors.\n\nAs of parted-2.4, when you specify start and/or end values using IEC binary units like “MiB”, “GiB”, “TiB”, etc., parted treats those values as exact, and equivalent to the same number specified in bytes (i.e., with the “B” suffix), in that it provides no “helpful” range of sloppiness. Contrast that with a partition start request of “4GB”, which may actually resolve to some sector up to 500MB before or after that point. Thus, when creating a partition, you should prefer to specify units of bytes (“B”), sectors (“s”), or IEC binary units like “MiB”, but not “MB”, “GB”, etc.\n\n"

Recreating the partition table of a device is also useful when the partition scheme needs to be restructured from scratch.\n\nOpen each device whose partition table must be (re)created with:\n\n```\n# parted /dev/sdx\n```\n\nTo then create a new GUID Partition Table, use the following command:\n\n```\n(parted) mklabel gpt\n```\n\nTo create a new Master Boot Record/MS-DOS partition table instead, use:\n\n```\n(parted) mklabel msdos\n```\n\n"

See Partitioning#Partition scheme for the required partitions.\n\nThe following command will be used to create partitions:\n\n```\n(parted) mkpart part-type-or-part-label fs-type start end\n```\n\n- part-type-or-part-label is interpreted differently based on the partition table: MBR: the parameter is interpreted as part-type, which can be one of primary, extended or logical. GPT: the parameter is interpreted as part-label, which sets the PARTLABEL attribute of the partition. To avoid setting a partition label, pass an empty quoted string (\"\"). Note: Many tutorials on the web use commands which start with mkpart primary even for GPT. They are wrong, this would set \"primary\" as the partition label.\n- fs-type is an identifier chosen among those listed by entering help mkpart as the closest match to the file system that you will use. The mkpart command does not actually create the file system: the fs-type parameter will simply be used by parted to set partition type GUID for GPT partitions or partition type ID for MBR partitions. Tip: parted maps types named after Linux native file systems to the same \"Linux filesystem\" partition type (GUID 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 or ID 0x83), so it is perfectly safe to e.g. use ext2 for an ext4-formatted partition. When using GPT, it is advised to follow the Discoverable Partitions Specification since systemd-gpt-auto-generator can automount them. The EFI system partition, XBOOTLDR partition, swap partition and home partition types can be changed using the set command, while for the root partition and others, you will need to specify the partition type UUID manually with the type command.\n- \n- start is the beginning of the partition from the start of the device. It consists of a number followed by a unit, for example 1MiB means start at 1 MiB.\n- end is the end of the partition from the start of the device (not from the start value). It has the same syntax as start, for example 100% means end at the end of the device (use all the remaining space).\n\n- MBR: the parameter is interpreted as part-type, which can be one of primary, extended or logical.\n- GPT: the parameter is interpreted as part-label, which sets the PARTLABEL attribute of the partition.

See bug #59176 and bug #55841.\n- parted may issue a warning like:\n\n```\nWarning: The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance.\nIgnore/Cancel?\n```\n\nThe following command will be used to flag the partition that contains the /boot directory as bootable:\n\n```\n(parted) set partition boot on\n```\n\n- partition is the number of the partition to be flagged (see the output of the print command).\n- esp is an alias for boot on GPT.
