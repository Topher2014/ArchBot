In cases where all packages and dependencies are wanted, it is recommended to create a temporary blank DB and reference it with --dbpath:\n\n```\n# mkdir /tmp/blankdb\n# pacman -Syw --cachedir . --dbpath /tmp/blankdb base base-devel grub-bios xorg gimp\n# repo-add ./custom.db.tar.zst ./*.pkg.tar.zst\n```\n\nThen you can burn the \"Packages\" directory to an optical disc (e.g. CD, DVD) or transfer it to a USB flash drive, external HDD, etc.\n\nTo install:\n\n1.

A package database is a tar file, optionally compressed. Valid extensions are .db or .files followed by an archive extension of .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, .tar.zst, or .tar.Z. The file does not need to exist, but all parent directories must exist.\n\nTo add a new package to the database, or to replace the old version of an existing package in the database, run:\n\n```\n$ repo-add /path/to/repo.db.tar.zst /path/to/package-1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst\n```\n\nThe database and the packages do not need to be in the same directory when using repo-add, but keep in mind that when using pacman with that database, they should be together. Storing all the built packages to be included in the repository in one directory also allows to use shell glob expansion to add or update multiple packages at once:\n\n```\n$ repo-add /path/to/repo.db.tar.zst /path/to/*.pkg.tar.zst\n```\n\nIf you are looking to support multiple architectures then precautions should be taken to prevent errors from occurring. Each architecture should have its own directory tree:\n\n```\n$ tree ~/customrepo/ | sed \"s/$(uname -m)/arch/g\"\n```\n\n```\n/home/archie/customrepo/\n└── arch\n    ├── customrepo.db -> customrepo.db.tar.zst\n    ├── customrepo.db.tar.zst\n    ├── customrepo.files -> customrepo.files.tar.zst\n    ├── customrepo.files.tar.zst\n    └── personal-website-git-b99cce0-1-arch.pkg.tar.zst\n\n1 directory, 5 files\n```\n\nThe repo-add executable checks if the package is appropriate. If this is not the case you will be running into error messages similar to this:\n\n```\n==> ERROR: '/home/archie/customrepo/arch/foo-arch.pkg.tar.zst' does not have a valid database archive extension.\n```\n\nrepo-remove is used to remove packages from the package database, except that only package names are specified on the command line.\n\n```\n$ repo-remove /path/to/repo.db.tar.zst pkgname\n```\n\nOnce the local repository database has been created, add the repository to pacman.conf for each system that is to use the repository. An example of a custom repository is in pacman.conf. The repository's name is the database filename with the file extension omitted. In the case of the example above the repository's name would simply be repo. Reference the repository's location using a file:// URL, or via HTTP using http://localhost/path/to/directory.\n\nIf willing, add the custom repository to the list of unofficial user repositories, so that the community can benefit from it.\n\n"
