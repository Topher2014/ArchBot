Subversion has since expanded beyond its original goal of replacing CVS, but its basic model, design, and interface remain heavily influenced by that goal.\"\n\nThis article deals with setting up an svn-server on your machine. There are two popular svn-servers, the built in svnserve and the more advanced option, Apache HTTP Server with svn plugins.\n\n"

Well, quite simply, it provides features that the standalone svnserve does not have...\n\n- HTTPS support. This is more secure than the MD5 authentication used by svnserve.\n- fine-grained access controls. You can use Apache auth to limit permissions by directory. This means you can grant read access to everything, but commit access only to trunk for instance, while have another group with commit access to tags or branches.\n- a free repository viewer\n- The Subversion team is working on seamless WebDAV integration. At some point you should be able to use any WebDAV interface to update files in the repository.\n\n"

Include the following inside of a virtual host directive:\n\n```\n<Location /svn>\n   DAV svn\n   SVNParentPath /home/svn/repositories\n   AuthzSVNAccessFile /home/svn/.svn-policy-file\n   AuthName \"SVN Repositories\"\n   AuthType Basic\n   AuthUserFile /home/svn/.svn-auth-file\n   Require valid-user\n</Location>\n```\n\nTo make sure the SSL settings get loaded, uncomment the SSL configuration line in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf so it looks like this:\n\n```\nLoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\nLoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so\nInclude /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf\n```\n\n"
