A Lenovo forum thread was made to discuss and bring this to Lenovo's attention, but they have yet to fix it.\n\nHowever, these firmware errors do not seem to have any obvious consequences (besides the hampered functionality of the _PDC ACPI object), so it is probably safe to disregard them. loglevel=3 can be passed as a kernel parameter to hide these errors (and others) during the boot process.\n\n"
