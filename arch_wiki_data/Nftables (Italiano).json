It provides a new packet filtering framework, a new user-space utility (nft), and a compatibility layer for {ip,ip6}tables. It uses the existing hooks, connection tracking system, user-space queueing component, and logging subsystem of netfilter.\n\nIt consists of three main components: a kernel implementation, the libnl netlink communication and the nftables user-space front-end. The kernel provides a netlink configuration interface, as well as run-time rule-set evaluation, libnl contains the low-level functions for communicating with the kernel, and the nftables front-end is what the user interacts with via nft.\n\nYou can also visit the official nftables wiki page for more information.\n\n"

However, each table only has one address family and only applies to packets of this family. Tables can have one of five families specified:\n\nTable content:\nnftables family | iptables utility\nip | iptables\nip6 | ip6tables\ninet | iptables and ip6tables\narp | arptables\nbridge | ebtables\n\nip (i.e. IPv4) is the default family and will be used if family is not specified.\n\nTo create one rule that applies to both IPv4 and IPv6, use inet. inet allows for the unification of the ip and ip6 families to make defining rules for both easier.\n\nSee nft(8) § ADDRESS FAMILIES for a complete description of address families.\n\nIn all of the following, family_type is optional, and if not specified is set to ip.\n\n"

A base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, where a hook value is specified. A regular chain may be used as a jump target for better organization.\n\nSee the traffic flow diagram showing the ordering between individual hooks. Within a given hook, netfilter performs operations in order of increasing numerical priority.\n\nIn all of the following family_type is optional, and if not specified is set to ip.\n\n"

See nft(8) § CHAINS for a list of supported family_type, chain_type and hook_type combinations.\n\npriority_value takes either a priority name or an integer value. See nft(8) § CHAINS for a list of standard priority names and values. Chains with lower numbers are processed first and can be negative. [5]\n\nOptionally base chains can have a policy (drop or the default accept), to define what happens to packets not explicitly accepted or refused in contained rules.\n\nFor example, to add a base chain that filters input packets:\n\n```\n# nft add chain inet my_table my_chain '{ type filter hook input priority 0; }'\n```\n\nReplace add with create in any of the above to add a new chain but return an error if the chain already exists.\n\nThe following adds a regular chain named chain_name to the table named table_name:\n\n```\n# nft add chain family_type table_name chain_name\n```\n\nFor example, to add a regular chain named my_tcp_chain to the my_table table of the inet address family:\n\n```\n# nft add chain inet my_table my_tcp_chain\n```\n\n"

If not specified, the rule is appended to the end of the chain.\n\nThe --handle switch, which can be added to any valid list command, must be used to determine a rule handle. This switch tells nft to list the handles in its output. The --numeric argument is useful for viewing some numeric output, like unresolved IP addresses.\n\n```\n# nft --handle --numeric list chain inet my_table my_input\n```\n\n```\ntable inet my_table {\n     chain input {\n          type filter hook input priority 0;\n          ip saddr 127.0.0.1 accept # handle 10\n     }\n}\n```\n\nTo prepend the rule to the position:\n\n```\n# nft insert rule family_type table_name chain_name handle handle_value statement\n```\n\nIf handle_value is not specified, the rule is prepended to the chain.\n\nTypically a statement includes some expression to be matched and then a verdict statement. Verdict statements include accept, drop, queue, continue, return, jump chain_name, and goto chain_name. Other statements than verdict statements are possible. See nft(8) for more information.\n\nThere are various expressions available in nftables and, for the most part, coincide with their iptables counterparts. The most noticeable difference is that there are no generic or implicit matches. A generic match was one that was always available, such as --protocol or --source. Implicit matches were protocol-specific, such as --sport when a packet was determined to be TCP.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of the matches available:\n\n- meta (meta properties, e.g. interfaces)\n- icmp (ICMP protocol)\n- icmpv6 (ICMPv6 protocol)\n- ip (IP protocol)\n- ip6 (IPv6 protocol)\n- tcp (TCP protocol)\n- udp (UDP protocol)\n- sctp (SCTP protocol)\n- ct (connection tracking)\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of match arguments (for a more complete list, see nft(8)):\n\n```\nmeta:\n  oif <output interface INDEX>\n  iif <input interface INDEX>\n  oifname <output interface NAME>\n  iifname <input interface NAME>\n\n  (oif and iif accept string arguments and are converted to interface indexes)\n  (oifname and iifname are more dynamic, but slower because of string matching)\n\nicmp:\n  type <icmp type>\n\nicmpv6:\n  type <icmpv6 type>\n\nip:\n  protocol <protocol>\n  daddr <destination address>\n  saddr <source address>\n\nip6:\n  daddr <destination address>\n  saddr <source address>\n\ntcp:\n  dport <destination port>\n  sport <source port>\n\nudp:\n  dport <destination port>\n  sport <source port>\n\nsctp:\n  dport <destination port>\n  sport <source port>\n\nct:\n  state <new | established | related | invalid>\n```\n\n"

Without it, the Network Address Translation rules would have to be updated every time the IP address of the interface changed.\n\nTo use it:\n\n- make sure masquerading is enabled in the kernel (true if you use the default kernel), otherwise during kernel configuration, set CONFIG_NFT_MASQ=m.\n- the masquerade keyword can only be used in chains of type nat.\n- masquerading is a kind of source NAT, so only works in the output path.\n\nExample for a machine with two interfaces: LAN connected to enp3s0, and public internet connected to enp2s0:\n\n```\ntable inet my_nat {\n  chain my_masquerade {\n    type nat hook postrouting priority srcnat;\n    oifname \"enp2s0\" masquerade\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince the table type is inet both IPv4 and IPv6 packets will be masqueraded.

You can find various workarounds on the internet which either involve patching iptables rules and ensuring a defined service start order or disabling dockers iptables management completely which makes using docker very restrictive (think port forwarding or docker-compose).\n\nA reliable method is letting docker run in a separate network namespace where it can do whatever it wants. It is probably best to not use iptables-nft to prevent docker from mixing nftables and iptables rules.\n\nUse the following docker service drop-in file:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/netns.conf\n```\n\n```\n[Service]\nPrivateNetwork=yes\nPrivateMounts=No\n\n# cleanup\nExecStartPre=-nsenter -t 1 -n -- ip link delete docker0\n\n# add veth\nExecStartPre=nsenter -t 1 -n -- ip link add docker0 type veth peer name docker0_ns\nExecStartPre=sh -c 'nsenter -t 1 -n -- ip link set docker0_ns netns \"$$BASHPID\" && true'\nExecStartPre=ip link set docker0_ns name eth0\n\n# bring host online\nExecStartPre=nsenter -t 1 -n -- ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev docker0\nExecStartPre=nsenter -t 1 -n -- ip link set docker0 up\n\n# bring ns online\nExecStartPre=ip addr add 10.0.0.100/24 dev eth0\nExecStartPre=ip link set eth0 up\nExecStartPre=ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 dev eth0\n```\n\nAdjust the 10.0.0.* IP addresses if they are not appropriate for your setup.\n\nEnable IP forwarding and set-up NAT for docker0 with the following postrouting rule:\n\n```\niifname docker0 oifname eth0 masquerade\n```\n\nThen, ensure that kernel IP forwarding is enabled.\n\nNow you can setup a firewall and port forwarding for the docker0 interface using nftables without any interference.\n\n"
