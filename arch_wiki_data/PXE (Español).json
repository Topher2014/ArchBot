The DHCP server responds with networking information (the IP address assigned to the client) and also provides, by using specific bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) parameters of the DHCP, additional information like the TFTP server address, the path of the initial network bootstrap program (NBP) to download or the boot configuration file name.\n\nThe NBP is transferred from the PXE server to the client using TFTP, to be loaded into memory and executed. The kernel and the initramfs are also transferred this way.\n\nThen the root file system is transferred using one of the following protocols: HTTP, NFS or NBD.\n\n"

E.g., for NFS:\n\n```\nLABEL archlinux\n        MENU LABEL Arch Linux x86_64\n        LINUX /path/to/extracted/Arch/ISO/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz-linux\n        INITRD /path/to/extracted/Arch/ISO/arch/boot/x86_64/initramfs-linux.img\n        APPEND archisobasedir=arch archiso_nfs_srv=pxeserver:/run/archiso/bootmnt cms_verify=y\n        SYSAPPEND 3\n        TEXT HELP\n        Arch Linux 2022.10.01 x86_64\n        ENDTEXT\n```\n\nThe LINUX and INITRD paths are relative to TFTP root. For NBD, replace archiso_nfs_srv with archiso_nbd_srv in the above example. See usage examples in boot/syslinux/archiso_pxe.cfg file resided on Arch Linux ISO.\n\nWhichever method you choose, you must pass ip= parameter to instruct the kernel to bring up the network interface before it attempts to mount the installation medium over the network. Passing BOOTIF= is required when there are several wired interfaces on the client side and/or you want resolv.conf to be already configured inside booted archiso. You can use sysappend mask 3 (which is 1+2) to pass these parameters automatically. For available boot parameters see README.bootparams.\n\n"
