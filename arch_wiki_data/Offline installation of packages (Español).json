      "content": "You can put the required files into /var/lib/pacman/sync and /var/cache/pacman/pkg, so as to make pacman think it has everything it needs to do searches, updates, and installs. The following method is based on two forum threads: [1][2].\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. downloading the up to date package databases on a computer with internet access,\n1. transferring them to the offline computer,\n1. generating the list of packages required from the offline computer to update it,\n1. downloading them with their signature on a computer with internet access,\n1. transferring them to the pacman cache of the offline computer,\n1. installing the updates.\n\nThe following script will download the updated package databases. If needed, change MIRROR to any mirror from the mirror status list.\n\n```\ndownload_databases.sh\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nARCH=\"x86_64\"\nMIRROR=\"https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/\"\n\nwget \"${MIRROR}/core/os/${ARCH}/core.db\"\nwget \"${MIRROR}/extra/os/${ARCH}/extra.db\"\nwget \"${MIRROR}/multilib/os/${ARCH}/multilib.db\"\n\n# and possibly -uncomment- (if customized in /etc/pacman.conf or pacman.conf.d):\n\n#wget \"${MIRROR}/core-testing/os/${ARCH}/core-testing.db\"\n#wget \"${MIRROR}/extra-testing/os/${ARCH}/extra-testing.db\"\n#wget \"${MIRROR}/multilib-testing/os/${ARCH}/multilib-testing.db\"\n\n# and -additionally- debug and staging packages.\n```\n\nMake the script executable and run it. You will obtain multiple .db files.\n\nThe following steps will be transferring the .db files to the offline PC, making it so you are working with up-to-date package lists (as if you ran pacman -Sy), then generating a list of package required for the update:\n\n```\n# cp *.db /var/lib/pacman/sync/\n# pacman -Sup --noconfirm > pkglist\n```\n\nYou will also need to download the corresponding package signatures, so prepare the list of signatures to download:\n\n```\n# sed -e 's/\\.zst$/.zst.sig/' ../pkglist > ../siglist\n```\n\nNext, bring the two lists with you to a place where you have internet and download the listed packages in an empty directory:\n\n```\n# wget -nv -i ../pkglist\n# wget -nv -i ../siglist\n```\n\nTake all the *.pkg.tar.zst and *.pkg.tar.zst.sig files back home, put them in /var/cache/pacman/pkg and finally run:\n\n```\n# pacman -Su\n```\n\n"

Continue configuring the new system as usual.\n\nFrom now on any updates to the offline system can be made by bringing an up to date copy of the local repository, mounting it to /repo and running pacman commands as usual.\n\n"
