If, after installation, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ncmpcpp/config has not been created, simply copy the sample config, change owner and edit at the very least the following three configuration options:\n\n- mpd_host - Should point to the host on which mpd resides, can be \"localhost\", \"127.0.0.1\" or \"::1\" if on the same machine. To connect with a password, write \"password@host\"\n- mpd_port - The default of mpd should be \"6600\"\n- mpd_music_dir - The same directory value as specified in \"music_directory\" in mpd.conf\n\nFor inspiration, see the following resources:\n\n- Sample configuration file in /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp/config.\n- Show your .ncmpcpp/config with screenshot forum thread\n\n"

      "content": "For visualization, add a few lines to /etc/mpd.conf or ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf to enable the generation of the fast Fourier transform data for the visualization:\n\n```\naudio_output {\n    type                    \"fifo\"\n    name                    \"my_fifo\"\n    path                    \"/tmp/mpd.fifo\"\n    format                  \"44100:16:2\"\n}\n```\n\nAdditional lines need to be added to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ncmpcpp/config\n\n```\nvisualizer_data_source = \"/tmp/mpd.fifo\"\nvisualizer_output_name = \"my_fifo\"\nvisualizer_in_stereo = \"yes\"\nvisualizer_type = \"spectrum\"\nvisualizer_look = \"+|\"\n```\n\n- visualizer_type - Set the visualization to either a spectrum/ellipse/wave_filled analyzer or wave form.\n- visualizer_look - Set the visualizer's look (string has to be exactly 2 characters long: first one is for wave and whereas second for frequency spectrum, wave_filled and ellipse).\n\nIf you use mopidy, visualization is handled via gstreamer's udpsink. Edit the output in the [audio] block of your mopidy.conf:\n\n```\noutput = tee name=t ! queue ! autoaudiosink t. ! queue ! audio/x-raw,rate=44100,channels=2,format=S16LE ! udpsink host=localhost port=5555\n```\n\nThis forwards the audio data to port 5555. For ncmpcpp to read from this port, change its visualizer_data_source accordingly:\n\n```\nvisualizer_data_source = \"localhost:5555\"\n```\n\n"

This opens a little window with two options: Get Tags from Filename and Rename files. If you choose Get Tags From Filename, a popup with two windows is shown. On the left side you can enter a pattern that extracts the selected information from the filenames. You can also hit Preview to see what the result would look like. On the right side you can see the legend containing all the possible keywords to be used for extraction.\n\nA simple Example would be the pattern: %a - %t. If your files are named according to this pattern (Artist - Title) then this pattern would extract this information and set the Tags for the File.\n\nThe other option Rename Files does the exact opposite. It takes the Tags from the audio files and creates a Filename from them.\n\n"
