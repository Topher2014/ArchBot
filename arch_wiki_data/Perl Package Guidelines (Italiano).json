Because there are two styles of build scripts, there are two example PKGBUILDS. The first PKGBUILD is an example of how to package a distribution that uses Makefile.PL.

When making use of the CPAN, procedures must be followed to fetch the source code of a module, build that fetched module, and insert it into the system software for later execution. In order to understand how modules should be packaged, it helps immensely if one understands how modules work without any involvement from pacman and Arch Linux packages. Our goal in the end is to try to be unobtrusive as possible, while improving organization and consistency in the end product.\n\n"

Sometimes this is not true, like with the Template-Toolkit distribution. The latest package, Template-Toolkit-2.22.tar.gz, for the Template-Toolkit dist, contains no Template::Toolkit module!\n\nSometimes because distributions are named after a main module, their names are used interchangeably and they get muddled together. However it is sometimes useful to consider them a separate entity (like in Template-Toolkit's case).\n\n"

The most useful index is in the /modules/02packages.details.txt.gz file available from each CPAN mirror. The term \"packages\" here refers to the package keyword in the perl language itself, not something similar to pacman packages. The CPAN shell, referred to as lowercased, italicized cpan, is simply the venerable perl script which navigates indices to find the module you want to install.\n\nModules are found in the 02packages.details.txt.gz list. On the same line as the module/package name is the path to the distribution tarball that contains the module. When you ask cpan to install a module, it will look up the module and install the relevant distribution. As the distribution is installing it will generate a list of module dependencies. Cpan will try to load each module dependency into the perl interpreter. If a module of the given version cannot be loaded the process is repeated.\n\nThe cpan shell does not have to worry about what version of the required module it is installing. cpan can rely on the fact that the latest version of the module must satisfy the requirements of the original module that it began installing in the first place. Only the latest versions of modules are listed in the packages details file. Unfortunately for the perl package author, we cannot always rely on the fact that our packages offer the most recent version of a perl distribution and the modules contained within. Pacman dependency checking is much more static and strongly enforced.\n\n"

      "title": "Module dependencies",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Perl has a unique way of defining dependencies compared to similar systems like python eggs and ruby gems. Eggs define dependencies on other eggs. Gems depend on gems. Perl dists depend on modules. Modules are only available from CPAN distributions so in a way perl distributions depend on distributions only indirectly. Modules can define their own versions independent from distributions inside the module source code. This is done by defining a package variable called $VERSION. When using strict and warnings, this is defined with the our keyword. For example:\n\n```\npackage Foo::Module;\nuse warnings;\nuse strict;\nour $VERSION = '1.00';\n```\n\nModules can change their versions however they like and even have a version distinct from the distribution version. The utility of this is questionable but it is important to keep in mind. Module versions are more difficult to determine from outside of the perl interpreter and require parsing the perl code itself and maybe even loading the module into perl. The advantage is that from inside the perl interpreter module versions are easy to determine. For example:\n\n```\nuse Foo::Module;\nprint $Foo::Module::VERSION, \"\\n\";\n```\n\n"

      "title": "Dependency definition",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Where are dependencies defined in perl distributions? They are \"defined\" inside of the Makefile.PL or Build.PL script. For example, inside of the Makefile.PL script the WriteMakeFile function is called to generate the Makefile like this:\n\n```\nuse ExtUtils::MakeMaker;\nWriteMakeFile(\n    'NAME' => 'ArchLinux::Module',\n    'VERSION' => '0.01',\n    'PREREQ_PM' => { 'POSIX' => '0.01' },\n);\n```\n\nThis is a contrived example but it is important to understand the dependencies are not final until after the Makefile.PL or Build.PL script is run. Dependencies are specified at runtime, which means they can be changed or modified using the full power of perl. This means the module author can add, remove, or change versions of dependencies right before the distribution is installed. Some modules authors use this to do overly clever things like depend on modules only if they are installed. Some multi-platform dists also depend on system-specific modules when installed on different operating systems.\n\nAs an example, the CPANPLUS distribution looks for CPANPLUS::Dist plugins that are currently installed. If any plugins are installed for the currently installed version of CPANPLUS it adds them to the new CPANPLUS's prerequisites. I'm not quite sure why. Luckily for the perl packager most dependencies are static like in the above example that requires the POSIX module with a minimum version of 0.01.\n\n"

Previously there were META.yml files in the YAML format but more recently the switch has been made to META.json files in the JSON format. These files can be edited by hand but more often they are generated automatically by Makefile.PL or Build.PL scripts when packaging a distribution for release. The latest specification is described in CPAN::Meta::Spec's online docs.\n\nRemember that dependencies can be changed at runtime! For this reason another meta file is generated after running the build script. This second meta file is called MYMETA.json and reflects changes the script made at runtime and may be different from the meta file generated when the distribution was packaged for CPAN.\n\nElderly distributions on the CPAN have no meta file at all. These old releases predate the idea of the META.yml file and only describe their prerequisites in their Makefile.PL.\n\n"

See Help:Style for reference.\n\nOne of perl's greatest strengths is the sheer number of modules available on CPAN. Not too surprisingly, there are also several different modules used for installing... well... modules! TMTOWTDI! I am not aware of a standard name for these types of modules, so I just called them \"Installation Modules\".\n\nThese modules are concerned with building the distribution and installing module files wherever the user prefers. This seems straightforward, but considering the number of different systems perl runs on, this can get complex. Installation modules all place a perl code file inside the dist tarball. Running this perl script will initiate the build and install process. The script always ends with the .PL suffix and is termed the \"Build script\" in the below list.\n\n"

The Makefile.PL files that are generated by MI look much different and are implemented using a simple domain specific language.\n\nOne very interesting feature is that Module::Install bundles a complete copy of itself into the distribution file. Because of this, unlike MakeMaker or M::B, you do not need Module::Install to be installed on your system.\n\nAnother very unique feature is auto-install. Though not recommended by Module::Install's authors this feature is used quite often. When the module author enables auto-install for their distribution, Module::Install will search for and install any pre-requisite modules that are not installed when Makefile.PL is executed. This feature is skipped when Module::Install detects it is being run by CPAN or CPANPLUS. However, this feature is not skipped when run inside... oh I do not know... a PKGBUILD! I hope you can see how a rogue perl program downloading and installing modules willy-nilly inside a PKGBUILD can be a problem.

There are also speed benefits to compiling your own custom perl interpreter (i.e. without threads). Another reason for a custom perl is simply because the official perl Arch Linux package sometimes lags behind perl releases. The user may be trying out the latest perl... who knows?\n\nIf the user has the custom perl executable in their $PATH, the custom perl will be run when the user types the perl command on the shell. In fact the custom perl will run inside the PKGBUILD as well! This can lead to insidious problems that are difficult to understand.\n\nThe problem lies in compiled XS modules. These modules bridge perl and C. As such they must use perl's internal C API to accomplish this bridge. Perl's C API changes slightly with different versions of perl. If the user has a different version of perl than the system perl (/usr/bin/perl) then any XS module compiled with the user's perl will be incompatible with the system-wide perl. When trying to use the compiled XS module with the system perl, the module will fail to load with a link error.\n\nA simple solution is to always use the absolute path of the system-wide perl interpreter (/usr/bin/perl) when running perl in the PKGBUILD.\n\n"
