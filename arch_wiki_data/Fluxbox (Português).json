It is based on the (now abandoned) Blackbox 0.61.1 code, but with significant enhancements and continued development. Fluxbox provides a number of window management features such as tabbing and grouping and has hundreds of styles (themes) available. All Fluxbox configuration is stored in plaintext files; however, some settings are exposed graphically in the configuration menu.\n\n"

As with other lightweight window managers, Fluxbox does not automatically update its menu when you install new applications. Therefore, the menu will need to be regenerated when new applications are installed/uninstalled.\n\nThe basic syntax for a menu item to appear is:\n\n```\n[exec] (name) {command} <path to icon>\n```\n\n...where \"name\" is the text you wish to appear for that menu item and \"command\" is the location of the binary, e.g.:\n\n```\n[exec] (Firefox Browser) {/usr/bin/firefox} <path to firefox icon>\n```\n\nNote that the \"<path to icon>\" is optional. If you want to create a submenu, the syntax is:\n\n```\n[submenu] (Name)\n...\n...\n[end]\n```\n\nWhen you have finished editing, save the file and exit. There is no need to restart Fluxbox. For more information, read editing the Fluxbox menu.\n\n"

      "level": 4,
      "content": "There are some programs which can generate either a complete Fluxbox root menu or a submenu of installed applications which can be manually included in an existing root menu definition. These are outlined below.\n\nThere is a built-in command provided with Fluxbox:\n\n```\n$ fluxbox-generate_menu\n```\n\nThis command will auto-generate a ~/.fluxbox/menu file based on your installed programs. However, the menu it generates will not be as comprehensive as that generated by MenuMaker.\n\nMenuMaker is a powerful tool that creates XML-based menus for a variety of Window Managers, including Fluxbox. MenuMaker will search your computer for executable programs and create a menu based on the results. It can be configured to exclude Legacy X, GNOME, KDE, or Xfce applications if desired.\n\nInstall menumaker, then you can generate a complete menu and overwrite the default one by running:\n\n```\n$ mmaker -f FluxBox\n```\n\nYou can avoid populating your menu with terminal based applications such as alsamixer(1) by running the following switches with the mmaker command: --no-legacy and --no-debian. For example:\n\n```\n$ mmaker -f --no-legacy --no-debian FluxBox\n```\n\nTo see more MenuMaker options:\n\n```\n$ mmaker --help\n```\n\nYou can also generate a menu using Xdg-menu. See the Xdg-menu#FluxBox section.\n\n"

Can be edited. See fluxbox-menu(5).\n- Toolbar menu: right click on empty part of toolbar.

See setxkbmap(1) for more options.\n\nTo make a help function in your menu, just add in ~/.fluxbox/menu:\n\n```\n[submenu] (Keyboard)\n      [exec] (normal) {setxkbmap us}\n      [exec] (international) {setxkbmap us -variant intl}\n[end]\n```\n\n"
