Even though Arch Linux is not one of the \"supported platforms\"; the installation process is relatively straightforward. We have a two method's of VMWare vCLI installation. It is a build package from AUR, or manually installation.\n\n"

Change the following rules:\n\n```\nmy $installed_ssl_version = '1.0.0';   # rule 5248\nmy $ssleay_installed = 1;              # rule 5250\nmy $OpenSSL_installed = 1;             # rule 5256\nmy $LibXML2_installed = 1;             # rule 5257\nmy $OpenSSL_dev_installed = 1;         # rule 5258\nmy $e2fsprogs_installed = 1;           # rule 5261 \nmy $e2fsprogs_version = '1.42';        # rule 5262\nmy $install_rhel55_local = 1;          # rule 5266\n```\n\nThe next step is to configure a ftp and http proxy. These values are mandatory, even when you are not using a proxy (in which case you leave the values in a blank state):\n\n```\nexport ftp_proxy=\"\"\nexport http_proxy=\"\"\n```\n\nFire up the installation:\n\n```\n./vmware-install.pl\n```\n\nPotential warnings about rpm and versions can be safely ignored.\n\n"
