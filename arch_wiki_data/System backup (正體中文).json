[It] primarily ensures that not only the user data in a system is saved, but also the system's state or operational condition. This helps in restoring the system to the last-saved state along with all the selected backup data.[1]\n\n"

The backup can also be used as a test bed for updates, with the testing repo enabled, etc. If you transferred the system to a different partition or drive and you want to boot it, the process is as simple as updating the backup's /etc/fstab and your boot loader's configuration file.\n\nThis section assumes that you backed up the system to another drive or partition, that your current boot loader is working fine, and that you want to boot from the backup as well.\n\n"

If you want to freshly install all GRUB files to somewhere other than /boot, such as /mnt/newroot/boot, use the --boot-directory flag.\n\nAlso verify the new menu entry in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Make sure the UUID is matching the new partition, otherwise it could still boot the old system. Find the UUID of a partition with lsblk:\n\n```\n$ lsblk -no NAME,UUID /dev/sdXY\n```\n\nwhere /dev/sdXY is the desired partition (e.g. /dev/sdb3). To list the UUIDs of partitions GRUB thinks it can boot, use grep:\n\n```\n# grep UUID= /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n```\n\n"
