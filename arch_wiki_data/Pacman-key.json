      "content": "Related articles\n\n- GnuPG\n- OpenPGP\n\nTo determine if packages are authentic, pacman uses OpenPGP keys in a web of trust model. The current Master Signing Keys are found here. At least three of these Master Signing Keys are used to sign the Developers' and Package Maintainers' own keys. They are then used to sign their packages. Each user also has a unique OpenPGP key, which is generated when you configure pacman-key(8). It is this web of trust that links the user's key to the master keys.\n\nExamples of webs of trust:\n\n- Custom packages: Packages made and signed with a local key.\n- Unofficial packages: Packages made and signed by a developer. Then, a local key was used to sign the developer's key.\n- Official packages: Packages made and signed by a developer. The developer's key was signed by the Arch Linux master keys. You used your key to sign the master keys, and you trust them to vouch for developers.\n\n"

      "content": "The SigLevel option in /etc/pacman.conf determines the level of trust required to install a package with pacman -S. For a detailed explanation of SigLevel, see pacman.conf(5) § PACKAGE AND DATABASE SIGNATURE CHECKING, and the file comments. One can set signature checking globally, or per repository. If SigLevel is set globally in the [options] section, all packages installed with pacman -S will require signing. With the LocalFileSigLevel setting from the default pacman.conf, any packages you build, and install with pacman -U, will not need to be signed using makepkg.\n\nFor remote packages, the default configuration will only support the installation of packages signed by trusted keys:\n\n```\n/etc/pacman.conf\n```\n\n```\nSigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional\n```\n\nTrustedOnly is a default compiled-in pacman parameter. The default configuration is identical to using the global option of:\n\n```\nSigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional TrustedOnly\n```\n\nThe above can be achieved too on a repository level further below in the configuration, e.g.:\n\n```\n[core]\nSigLevel = PackageRequired\nInclude = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist\n```\n\nexplicitly adds signature checking for the packages of the repository, but does not require the database to be signed. Optional here would turn off a global Required for this repository.\n\n"

The last eight digits of the fingerprint serve as a name for the key known as the '(short) key ID' (the last sixteen digits of the fingerprint would be the 'long key ID').\n\n"

Whenever pacman encounters a key it does not recognize, it will prompt you to download it from a keyserver configured in /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf (or by using the --keyserver option on the command line). Wikipedia maintains a list of keyservers.\n\nOnce you have downloaded a developer key, you will not have to download it again, and it can be used to verify any other packages signed by that developer.\n\n"

Then add it to the keyring using one of the two methods:\n\n1. If the key is found on a keyserver, import it with: # pacman-key --recv-keys keyid\n1. If otherwise a link to a keyfile is provided, download it and then run: # pacman-key --add /path/to/downloaded/keyfile\n\n```\n# pacman-key --recv-keys keyid\n```\n\n```\n# pacman-key --add /path/to/downloaded/keyfile\n```\n\nIt is recommended to verify the fingerprint, as with any master key or any other key you are going to sign:\n\n```\n$ pacman-key --finger keyid\n```\n\nFinally, you must locally sign the imported key:\n\n```\n# pacman-key --lsign-key keyid\n```\n\nYou now trust this key to sign packages.\n\n"
