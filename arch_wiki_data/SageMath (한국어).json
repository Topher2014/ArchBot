It is meant to provide an alternative for commercial programs such as Maple, Matlab, and Mathematica.\n\nSageMath provides support for the following:\n\n- Calculus: using Maxima and SymPy.\n- Linear Algebra: using the GSL, SciPy and NumPy.\n- Statistics: using R (through RPy) and SciPy.\n- Graphs: using matplotlib.\n- An interactive shell using IPython.\n- Access to Python modules such as PIL, SQLAlchemy, etc.\n\n"

For an extensive tutorial on IPython see the community maintained IPython Cookbook.\n\nNote, however, that it is not very comfortable for some uses such as plotting. When you try to plot something, for example:\n\n```\nsage: plot(sin,(x,0,10))\n```\n\nSageMath opens the plot in an external application.\n\n"

You can instead start the Notebook without requiring login, and have it automatically pop up in a browser, with the following command:\n\n```\n$ sage -c \"notebook(automatic_login=True)\"\n```\n\n"

TeX Live is made aware of SageTeX automatically so you can start using it straight away.\n\nAs a simple example, here is how you include a Sage 2D plot in your TEX document (assuming you use pdflatex):\n\n- include the sagetex package in the preamble of your document with the usual\n\n```\n\\usepackage{sagetex}\n```\n\n- create a sagesilent environment in which you insert your code:\n\n```\n\\begin{sagesilent}\ndob(x) = sqrt(x^2 - 1) / (x * arctan(sqrt(x^2 - 1)))\ndpr(x) = sqrt(x^2 - 1) / (x * log( x + sqrt(x^2 - 1)))\np1 = plot(dob,(x, 1, 10), color='blue')\np2 = plot(dpr,(x, 1, 10), color='red')\nptot = p1 + p2\nptot.axes_labels(['$\\\\xi$','$\\\\frac{R_h}{\\\\max(a,b)}$'])\n\\end{sagesilent}\n```\n\n- create the plot, e.g. inside a float environment:\n\n```\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\sageplot[width=\\linewidth]{ptot}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n```\n\n- compile your document with the following procedure:\n\n```\n$ pdflatex <doc.tex>\n$ sage <doc.sagetex.sage>\n$ pdflatex <doc.tex>\n```\n\n- you can have a look at your output document.\n\nThe full documentation of SageTeX is available on CTAN.\n\n"
