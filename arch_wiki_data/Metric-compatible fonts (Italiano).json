Due to their matching metrics, replacing a font with a metric-compatible alternative does not change the formatting of the document or a web page. Such fonts are often developed for FOSS systems to display pages correctly.\n\n"

While some of these fonts are just a cheaper version (or look-alike) of corresponding PostScript families, Cambria and Calibri (default font since MS Office 2007) are independent from other families. Microsoft used to provide many core fonts in its Core fonts for the Web project. Although this project is later unavailable on Microsoft's site, the license terms that allow these fonts to be distributed from third-party sites make packages like ttf-ms-fontsAUR possible. See also Microsoft fonts.\n\nPrior to the introduction of Arial and Times New Roman, Microsoft used two bitmap fonts called Helv and Tms Rmn in Windows 1.0, each being unlicensed imitations of better-known fonts already covered here. They were later renamed MS Sans Serif and MS Serif starting with Windows 3.1, and MS Sans Serif was eventually vectorized into \"Microsoft Sans Serif\". Documents using these fonts are rare, but user interfaces that use Microsoft Sans Serif can occasionally be found in Mono libgdiplus applications. It is generally safe to assume these fonts are metric-compatible with Helvetica and Times when trying to replace them.\n\n"
