Throughout the years the range of terminal colors has been vastly expanded, from the initial eight colors to a full 24-bit truecolor.\n\nThe basic color encoding provides 8 normal-brightness colors and 8 brighter versions of these colors. Modern terminal emulators, including the Linux console itself, allows you to specify the precise RGB values that the colors translate to. This mode is supported by almost all terminal emulators.\n\nWith the advent of 256-color displays came the 256-color escape. The 256 colors are the 16 basic colors, the 216 RGB colors (laid out in a 6x6x6 cube), and 24 levels of greyscale. Except for the first 16 colors, the scheme is usually not customizable as it has a well-defined mapping to RGB. This mode is supported by most terminal emulators. (A minority of emulators use a similar but incompatible encoding with only 88 colors. You are very unlikely to use them in practice, but they will appear in the terminfo database.)\n\nLess commonly supported is the truecolor mode, allowing one to use 16.7 million (224) colors in RGB (each value ranging from 0 to 255).\n\n"

This is usually because the program tries to detect if its stdout is an interactive terminal, in which case it prints colored text, and otherwise prints uncolored text. This is good behaviour when you want to redirect stdout to a file, e.g. pacman -Qe > pkglst-backup.txt, but less suited when you want to view output in less.\n\nSome programs provide an option to disable the interactive tty detection:\n\n```\n# dmesg --color=always | less\n```\n\nIn case that the program does not provide any similar option, it is possible to trick the program into thinking its stdout is an interactive terminal with the following utilities:\n\n- ColorThis — Force colored output of a program by running it within a (group of) pty, support forwarding stdin.\n\n- stdoutisatty — A small program and a LD_PRELOAD-able library that catches the isatty(3) function call.\n\n- unbuffer — A tclsh script comes with expect, it invokes desired program within a pty.\n\nAlternatively, using zpty module from zsh: [2]\n\n```\n~/.zshrc\n```\n\n```\nzmodload zsh/zpty\n\npty() {\n\tzpty pty-${UID} ${1+$@}\n\tif [[ ! -t 1 ]];then\n\t\tsetopt local_traps\n\t\ttrap '' INT\n\tfi\n\tzpty -r pty-${UID}\n\tzpty -d pty-${UID}\n}\n\nptyless() {\n\tpty $@ | less\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```\n$ ptyless program\n```\n\nTo pipe it to other pager (less in this example):\n\n```\n$ pty program | less\n```\n\n"

      "content": "Some terminals support the full range of 16 million colors (RGB, each with 8 bit resolution): xterm, konsole, st, etc. The corresponding TERM values xterm-direct, konsole-direct, st-direct, etc. are supported starting with ncurses version 6.1 [4]. For more info about terminal emulators and applications that support true color, see [5].\n\nNote that the Linux kernel supports the SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) escape sequences for true-color, but it is pointless to use it, because the driver maps the 24-bit color specifications to a 256-colors color map in the kernel (see the functions rgb_foreground, rgb_background). For this reason, there is no terminfo entry linux-direct.\n\n"
