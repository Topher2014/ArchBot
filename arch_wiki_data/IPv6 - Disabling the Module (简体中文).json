If you want to limit the advertised prefixes instead of ::/64 use the desired prefix, e.g. 2001:DB8::/64. The prefix block can be repeated many times for more prefixes.\n\nTo advertise DNS servers to your LAN clients you can use RDNSS feature. For example, add the following lines to /etc/radvd.conf to advertise Google's DNS v6 servers:\n\n```\nRDNSS 2001:4860:4860::8888 2001:4860:4860::8844 {\n};\n```\n\nThe gateway must also allow the traffic of ipv6-icmp packets on all basic chains.

This may raise privacy concerns as the MAC address of the computer can be easily derived by the IPv6 address. In order to tackle this problem the IPv6 Privacy Extensions standard (RFC 4941) has been developed. With privacy extensions the kernel generates a temporary address that is mangled from the original autoconfigured address. Private addresses are preferred when connecting to a remote server so the original address is hidden. To enable Privacy Extensions reproduce the following steps:\n\nAdd the following sysctl parameters:\n\n```\n/etc/sysctl.d/40-ipv6.conf\n```\n\n```\n# Enable IPv6 Privacy Extensions\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.use_tempaddr = 2\nnet.ipv6.conf.nic.use_tempaddr = 2\n```\n\nWhere nic is your Network Interface Card. You can find their names using the instructions in Network configuration#Listing network interfaces. The all.use_tempaddr or default.use_tempaddr parameters are not applied to nic's that already exist when the sysctl settings are executed.\n\nAfter a reboot, at the latest, Privacy Extensions should be enabled.\n\n"

A router can be configured to assign different network prefixes to various subnetworks. The ISP hands out a network prefix using DHCPv6 (usually a /56 or /64) and a dhcp client assigns the prefixes to the local network. For a simple two interface gateway it practically assigns an IPv6 prefix to the interface connected to the local network from an address acquired through the interface connected to WAN (or a pseudo-interface such as ppp).\n\nDHCPv6 requires the client to receive incoming connections on port 546 UDP. For an nftables-based firewall, that can be configured with one line in the input chain in /etc/nftables.conf:\n\n```\ntable inet filter {\n  chain input {\n    udp dport dhcpv6-client accept\n    ...\n  }\n...\n}\n```\n\n"
