      "content": "Note: **not supported** \n\nAUR helpers automate usage of the Arch User Repository. In particular, they may automate the following tasks:\n\n- searching for packages published on the AUR;\n- resolving of dependencies between AUR packages;\n- retrieve and build AUR packages;\n- retrieve web content, such as user comments;\n- submission of AUR packages.\n\nPacman only handles updates for pre-built packages in its repositories. AUR packages are redistributed in form of PKGBUILDs and need an AUR helper to automate the re-build process. However, keep in mind that a rebuild of a package may be required when its shared library dependencies are updated, not only when the package itself is updated.\n\n"
