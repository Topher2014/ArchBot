      "content": "Preloading is the action of putting and keeping target files into the RAM. The benefit is that preloaded applications start more quickly because reading from the RAM is always quicker than from the hard drive. However, part of your RAM will be dedicated to this task, but no more than if you kept the application open. Therefore preloading is best used with large and often-used applications like Firefox and LibreOffice.\n\n"

To use it, first run this command in a terminal for each program you want to preload at boot:\n\n```\n# gopreload-prepare program\n```\n\nFor regular users, take ownership of /usr/share/gopreload/enabled and /usr/share/gopreload/disabled:\n\n```\n# chown username:users /usr/share/gopreload/enabled /usr/share/gopreload/disabled\n```\n\nand then gopreload each program you want to preload:\n\n```\n$ gopreload-prepare program\n```\n\nThen, as instructed, press Enter when the program is fully loaded. This will add a list of files needed by the program in /usr/share/gopreload/enabled. To load all lists at boot, enable the systemd service file gopreload.service.\n\nTo disable the loading of a program, remove the appropriate list in /usr/share/gopreload/enabled or move it to /usr/share/gopreload/disabled.\n\nIt is advised to run gopreload-prepare after system upgrades to refresh the file lists. For the task, the following batch tool come handy:\n\n```\n# gopreload-batch-refresh.sh\n```\n\nJust let it run without using the system.\n\n"
