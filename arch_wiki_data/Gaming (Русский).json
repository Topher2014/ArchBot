Changes to this situation have accelerated, starting from 2021 onward, as big players like Valve, the CodeWeavers group and the community have made tremendous improvements to the ecosystem, allowing Linux to truly become a viable platform for gaming. Further, more and more indie development teams strive to use cross-platform rendering engines in order to have their game able to compile and run on Linux.\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, the majority of user's thoughts are often directed towards popular AAA games which are usually written exclusively for the Microsoft Windows platform. This is understandable, however, it is not the only and sole availability. Please refer to #Game environments and #Getting games further down the page where you can find software to run games from other platforms.\n\nIf you however are fixated on getting games written for Microsoft Windows to work on Linux, then a different mindset, tools and approach is required; understanding internals and providing functional substitution. Please read #Game technicality below.\n\n"

      "content": "There are ultimately three complications that arise from attempting to play AAA games made for Windows on Linux. They are:\n\nGraphics SDK forward graphical calls to the underlying graphics driver which then proceeds to talking to the GPU hardware.\n\nA huge amount of games use DirectX as their main driving SDK. Linux, natively supports only OpenGL and Vulkan. Linux by itself does not support DirectX or any of the aforementioned technologies (Visual C++, MFC, .NET).\n\nInstead, several opensource equivalents have been written which attempt to provide identical functionality, ultimately achieving the same result from a graphics point of view. These equivalents have their \"own\" written substitutes which attempt to \"re-invent\" what the original SDK calls would possibly achieve from a black box point of view. Popular ones include:\n\n- Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) [provides a \"loader vm\", self written dependencies, interop and more]\n- Proton (forked Wine project, optimized for Steam by Valve)\n- Mono (.NET alternative)\n- MF-Media (media foundation dependencies)\n\nFor example, a call to load, transform and shade vertices on DirectX may be re-written from scratch in a new .dll/.so owned by Wine, providing their own \"hypothetical\" belief on what the function may be doing underneath, and forward it instead to an OpenGL alternative, effectively trying to achieve similar results. Since these calls are direct equivalents and treated \"as if\" DirectX was running, performance is not impacted. (with the exception of the starting overhead to interop with these)\n\nThese tools are often brought in the distribution together on the system at the same time. A prefix (Wine's terminology for a directory mimicking a Windows sandbox) is created and configured. Dependencies are installed inside the prefix (the \"sandbox\" still needs the game's redistributables), often with winetricks, followed by an attempt to run the game \"as if\" it was executed from Windows.\n\nThis, nowadays, fortunately works for most games (aside from anti-cheat protected ones, which require a kernel driver that Wine/Proton does not yet have). If a game does not work, it is usually as a result of incompatible packages, missing dependencies or unimplemented functionality by Wine/Proton.\n\nLutris is a piece of software that provides runners and sandboxes that handle dependencies for you when you install games, if the above process is found tedious and/or complicated.\n\n"

Most games run out of the box once the ROM is fed in to the emulator and issues are rarely encountered. For options, see Video game platform emulators.\n- Java - write once, run everywhere platform. Examples of popular games that run on Linux are Minecraft, Runescape, Wurm Online, Puzzle Pirates.\n- Web – games running in a web browser. HTML5 games use canvas and WebGL technologies and work in all modern browsers. Flash-based – you need to install the plugin to play.\n- Wine – Windows compatibility layer, allows to run Windows applications (and a lot of games) on Unix-like operating systems. Supports DirectX to Vulkan translation in runtime with the addition of Wine#DXVK, which improves performance in games which only support DirectX.\n- Virtual machines – can be used to install compatible operating systems (such as Windows). VirtualBox has good 3D support. As an extension of this, if you have compatible hardware you can consider VGA passthrough to a Windows KVM guest, keyword is \"virtual function I/O\" (VFIO), or PCI passthrough via OVMF.\n- Proton/DXVK – Fork of Wine designed for use in the proprietary steam platform, enabling better support for games than Wine.

The new X server will be akin a remote access login for the ALSA, so your user need to be part of the audio group to be able to hear any sound.\n\nTo start a second X server (using the free first person shooter game Xonotic as an example) you can simply do:\n\n```\n$ xinit /usr/bin/xonotic-glx -- :1 vt$XDG_VTNR\n```\n\nThis can further be spiced up by using a separate X configuration file:\n\n```\n$ xinit /usr/bin/xonotic-glx -- :1 -xf86config xorg-game.conf vt$XDG_VTNR\n```\n\nA good reason to provide an alternative xorg.conf here may be that your primary configuration makes use of NVIDIA's Twinview which would render your 3D games like Xonotic in the middle of your multiscreen setup, spanned across all screens. This is undesirable, thus starting a second X with an alternative configuration where the second screen is disabled is advised.

The following kernel parameter changes improve the response time consistency for the realtime kernel as well as other kernels such as the default linux kernel:\n\nProactive compaction for (Transparent) Hugepage allocation reduces the average but not necessarily the maximum allocation stalls.

Reserving 1GB:\n\n```\n# echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes\n```\n\nIf you have enough free RAM increase the watermark scale factor to further reduce the likelihood of allocation stalls (explanations [9][10]).

The following scheduler settings are in conflict with cfs-zen-tweaksAUR so for each setting choose only one provider. By default the linux kernel scheduler is optimized for throughput and not latency. The following hand-made settings change that and are tested with different games to be a noticeable improvement. They might not be optimal for your use case; consider modifying them as necessary [19][20][21]:\n\n```\n# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first\n# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled\n# echo 3000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us\n# echo 3000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/base_slice_ns\n# echo 500000 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/migration_cost_ns\n# echo 8 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/nr_migrate\n```\n\n"

Higher total throughput if your application can make use of the additional threads\n1. More run-queues for the scheduler and therefore on average less waiting time for a process thread to get scheduled on a core\n\nAdvantages of disabling SMT:\n\n1. Higher single core performance due to not needing to share core internal resources and the ability of the kernel and firmware to disable SMT related security mitigations\n1. More consistent single core performance. Depending on your processors microarchitecture, SMT shares various processor internal resources like instruction decoding units, micro-operations cache, register renaming capabilities, L1-, L2-Cache and translation lookaside buffer entries. Depending on what a sibling thread does, the throughput of a main thread varies. SMT also lessens the fairness of the process scheduler even if it is aware of SMT.\n\nIf you disable SMT do so in the BIOS/UEFI to get better single core performance.\n\n"
