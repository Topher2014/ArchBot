VirtualBox is in constant development and new features are implemented continuously. It comes with a Qt graphical user interface, as well as headless and SDL command-line tools for managing and running virtual machines.\n\nIn order to integrate functions of the host system to the guests, including shared folders and clipboard, video acceleration and a seamless window integration mode, guest additions are provided for some guest operating systems.\n\nFor more information, see the official documentation.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "VirtualBox supports the following virtual disk formats:\n\n- VDI: The Virtual Disk Image is the VirtualBox own open container used by default when you create a virtual machine with VirtualBox.\n- VMDK: The Virtual Machine Disk has been initially developed by VMware for their products. The specification was initially closed source, but has since become an open format which is fully supported by VirtualBox. This format offers the ability to be split into several 2GB files. This feature is especially useful if you want to store the virtual machine on machines which do not support very large files. Other formats, excluding the HDD format from Parallels, do not provide such an equivalent feature.\n- VHD: The Virtual Hard Disk is the format used by Microsoft in Windows Virtual PC and Hyper-V. If you intend to use any of these Microsoft products, you will have to choose this format.\n\n- VHDX (read only): This is the eXtended version of the Virtual Hard Disk format developed by Microsoft, which has been released on 2012-09-04 with Hyper-V 3.0 coming with Windows Server 2012. This new version of the disk format does offer enhanced performance (better block alignment), larger blocks size, and journal support which brings power failure resiliency. VirtualBox should support this format in read only.\n- HDD (version 2): The HDD format is developed by Parallels Inc and used in their hypervisor solutions like Parallels Desktop for Mac. Newer versions of this format (i.e. 3 and 4) are not supported due to the lack of documentation for this proprietary format. Note: There is currently a controversy regarding the support of the version 2 of the format. While the official VirtualBox manual only reports the second version of the HDD file format as supported, Wikipedia's contributors are reporting the first version may work too. Help is welcome if you can perform some tests with the first version of the HDD format.\n- QED: The QEMU Enhanced Disk format is an old file format for QEMU, another free and open source hypervisor. This format was designed from 2010 in a way to provide a superior alternative to QCOW2 and others. This format features a fully asynchronous I/O path, strong data integrity, backing files, and sparse files. QED format is supported only for compatibility with virtual machines created with old versions of QEMU.\n- QCOW: The QEMU Copy On Write format is the current format for QEMU. The QCOW format does support zlib-based transparent compression and encryption (the latter is flawed and is not recommended). QCOW is available in two versions: QCOW and QCOW2. QCOW2 tends to supersede the first one. QCOW is currently fully supported by VirtualBox. QCOW2 comes in two revisions: QCOW2 0.10 and QCOW2 1.1 (which is the default when you create a virtual disk with QEMU). VirtualBox does not support QCOW2.\n- OVF: The Open Virtualization Format is an open format which has been designed for interoperability and distributions of virtual machines between different hypervisors. VirtualBox supports all revisions of this format via the VBoxManage import/export feature but with known limitations.\n- RAW: This is the mode when the virtual disk is exposed directly to the disk without being contained in a specific file format container. VirtualBox supports this feature in several ways: converting RAW disk to a specific format, or by cloning a disk to RAW, or by using directly a VMDK file which points to a physical disk or a simple file.\n\n"

Then you can mount them as usual (e.g. mount mount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/).\n\nYou can also use mount.vdi script that, which you can use as (install script itself to /usr/bin/):\n\n```\n# mount -t vdi -o fstype=ext4,rw,noatime,noexec vdi_file_location /mnt/\n```\n\nAlternately you can use the nbd kernel module and qemu-nbd from qemu-img[2]:\n\n```\n# modprobe nbd max_part=16\n# qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 storage.vdi\n# mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt/dir/\n```\n\nAnd then to unmount:\n\n```\n# umount /mnt/dir/\n# qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0\n```\n\nIf the partition nodes are not propagated try using partprobe /dev/nbd0; otherwise, a VDI partition can be mapped directly to a node by: qemu-nbd -P 1 -c /dev/nbd0 storage.vdi.\n\nAnother way is to use vdfuseAUR:\n\n```\n# vdfuse -a -f storage.vdi mountpoint1\n```\n\nwhich mounts the disk in mountpoint1 with the PartitionN naming format.

However, in your virtual machine, it can appear without any mapping in /dev/sdaX for example, because the drivers controlling the fake RAID in your host operating system (e.g. Windows) are abstracting the fake RAID device.\n\nTo circumvent this problem, we will need to use an addressing scheme that is persistent to both systems.

Unfortunately, VirtualBox does not have this option in the GUI, so we will have to use the console and use an internal command of VBoxManage.\n\nBoot the host which will use the Arch Linux virtual machine. The command will need to be adapted according to the host you have.\n\nThere are 3 ways to achieve this: login as root, changing the access right of the device with chmod, adding your user to the disk group. The latter way is the more elegant, let us proceed that way:\n\n```\n# gpasswd -a your_user disk\n```\n\nApply the new group settings with:\n\n```\n$ newgrp\n```\n\nNow, you can use the command:\n\n```\n$ VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb -register\n```\n\nAdapt the above command to your need, especially the path and filename of the VMDK location and the raw disk location to map which contain your Arch Linux installation.\n\nOpen a command prompt must be run as administrator.\n\nOn Windows, as the disk filename convention is different from UNIX, use this command to determine what drives you have in your Windows system and their location:\n\n```\n# wmic diskdrive get name,size,model\n```\n\n```\nModel                               Name                Size\nWDC WD40EZRX-00SPEB0 ATA Device     \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1  4000783933440\nKINGSTON SVP100S296G ATA Device     \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0  96024821760\nHitachi HDT721010SLA360 ATA Device  \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE2  1000202273280\nInnostor Ext. HDD USB Device        \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE3  1000202273280\n```\n\nIn this example, as the Windows convention is \\\\.\\PhysicalDriveX where X is a number from 0, \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1 could be analogous to /dev/sdb from the Linux disk terminology.\n\nTo use the VBoxManage command on Windows, you can either, change the current directory to your VirtualBox installation folder first with cd C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\\n\n```\n# .\\VBoxManage.exe internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\\file.vmdk -rawdisk \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1\n```\n\nor use the absolute path name:\n\n```\n# \"C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe\" internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\\file.vmdk -rawdisk \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1\n```\n\nThere are other limitations regarding the aforementioned command when used in other operating systems like OS X, please thus read carefully the manual page, if you are concerned.\n\n- To make use of the VBoxManage command on Windows, you need to change the current directory to your VirtualBox installation folder first: cd C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox\\.\n- Windows makes use of backslashes instead of slashes, please replace all slashes \"/\" occurrences by backslashes \"\\\" in the commands that follow when you will use them.\n\nAfter, we need to create a new machine (replace the virtual_machine_name to your convenience) and register it with VirtualBox.\n\n```\n$ VBoxManage createvm -name virtual_machine_name -register\n```\n\nThen, the newly raw disk needs to be attached to the machine. This will depend if your computer or actually the root of your native Arch Linux installation is on an IDE or a SATA controller.\n\nIf you need an IDE controller:\n\n```\n$ VBoxManage storagectl virtual_machine_name --name \"IDE Controller\" --add ide\n$ VBoxManage storageattach virtual_machine_name --storagectl \"IDE Controller\" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium /path/to/file.vmdk\n```\n\notherwise:\n\n```\n$ VBoxManage storagectl virtual_machine_name --name \"SATA Controller\" --add sata\n$ VBoxManage storageattach virtual_machine_name --storagectl \"SATA Controller\" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium /path/to/file.vmdk\n```\n\nWhile you continue using the CLI, it is recommended to use the VirtualBox GUI, to personalise the virtual machine configuration. Indeed, you must specify its hardware configuration as close as possible as your native machine: turning on the 3D acceleration, increasing video memory, setting the network interface, etc.\n\nFinally, you may want to seamlessly integrate your Arch Linux with your host operating system and allow copy pasting between both operating systems.

The solution proposed by Microsoft is to reuse the same controller or use one of the same serial, which is impossible to achieve since we are using a Virtual Machine. MergeIDE, a German tool, developped upon another other solution proposed by Microsoft can be used. That solution basically consists in taking all IDE/ATA controller drivers supported by Windows XP from the initial driver archive (the location is hard coded, or specify it as the first argument to the .bat script), installing them and registering them with the regedit database.\n- Use the right type of Hardware Abstraction Layer (old 32 bits Windows versions): Microsoft ships 3 default versions: Hal.dll (Standard PC), Halacpi.dll (ACPI HAL) and Halaacpi.dll (ACPI HAL with IO APIC). Your Windows install could come installed with the first or the second version. In that way, please disable the Enable IO/APIC VirtualBox extended feature.\n- Disable any AGP device driver (only outdated Windows versions): If you have the files agp440.sys or intelppm.sys inside the C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\drivers\\ directory, remove it. As VirtualBox uses a PCI virtual graphics card, this can cause problems when this AGP driver is used.\n- Create a Windows recovery disk: In the following steps, if things turn bad, you will need to repair your Windows installation.

If a new disk dialog does not appear, navigate to the CD drive and start the installer manually.\n\n- You should finally have a working Windows virtual machine.

For example:\n\n```\n$ VBoxManage setextradata \"Arch Linux\" \"CustomVideoMode1\" \"1360x768x24\"\n```\n\nThe parameters \"Arch Linux\" and \"1360x768x24\" in the example above should be replaced with your VM name and the desired framebuffer resolution. Incidentally, this command allows for defining up to 16 extra resolutions (\"CustomVideoMode1\" through \"CustomVideoMode16\"). Recommended resolutions are 1280x720, 1920x1080, 2048x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160, 1280x800, 1280x1024, 1440x900, 1600x900.\n\nAfterwards, restart the virtual machine and run hwinfo --framebuffer once more to verify that the new resolutions have been recognized by your guest system (which does not guarantee they will all work, depending on your hardware limitations).\n\nFinally, add a video=resolution kernel parameter to set the framebuffer to the new resolution, for example:\n\n```\nvideo=1360x768\n```\n\nAdditionally you may want to configure your boot loader to use the same resolution.
