It was derived from GRUB, the GRand Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich Stefan Boleyn.\n\nBriefly, the boot loader is the first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is responsible for loading and transferring control to the Linux kernel. The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of the operating system.\n\n"

Familiarize yourself with GRUB commands before proceeding (e.g. \"find\" has been replaced with \"search\").\n- GRUB is now modular and no longer requires \"stage 1.5\". As a result, the boot loader itself is limited -- modules are loaded from the hard drive as needed to expand functionality (e.g. for LVM or RAID support).\n- Device naming has changed between GRUB Legacy and GRUB. Partitions are numbered from 1 instead of 0 while drives are still numbered from 0, and prefixed with partition-table type. For example, /dev/sda1 would be referred to as (hd0,msdos1) (for MBR) or (hd0,gpt1) (for GPT).\n- GRUB is noticeably bigger than GRUB legacy (occupies ~13 MB in /boot). If you are booting from a separate /boot partition, and this partition is smaller than 32 MB, you will run into disk space issues, and pacman will refuse to install new kernels.\n\n"

So, the second partition on the first hard disk will be defined as (hd0,1).\n\nIf you are unaware of the location of /boot, use the GRUB shell find command to locate the GRUB files.

This allows the distribution to manage its own menu.lst and boot options.\n\n- The chainloader command will load another boot loader (rather than a kernel image); useful if another boot loader is installed in a partition's boot sector (GRUB, for example). This allows one to install a \"main\" instance of GRUB to the MBR and distribution-specific instances of GRUB to each partition boot record (PBR).\n\n- The configfile command will instruct the currently running GRUB instance to load the specified configuration file. This can be used to load another distribution's menu.lst without a separate GRUB installation. The caveat of this approach is that other menu.lst may not be compatible with the installed version of GRUB; some distributions heavily patch their versions of GRUB.\n\nFor example, GRUB is to be installed to the MBR and some other boot loader (be it GRUB or LILO) is already installed to the boot sector of (hd0,2).\n\n```\n---------------------------------------------\n|   |           |           |   %           |\n| M |           |           | B %           |\n| B |  (hd0,0)  |  (hd0,1)  | L %  (hd0,2)  |\n| R |           |           |   %           |\n|   |           |           |   %           |\n---------------------------------------------\n  |                           ^\n  |       chainloading        |\n  -----------------------------\n```\n\nOne can simply include in menu.lst:\n\n```\ntitle Other Linux\nroot (hd0,2)\nchainloader +1\n```\n\nOr, if the boot loader on (hd0,2) is GRUB:\n\n```\ntitle Other Linux\nroot (hd0,2)\nconfigfile /boot/grub/menu.lst\n```\n\nThe chainloader command can also be used to load the MBR of a second drive:\n\n```\ntitle Other drive\nrootnoverify (hd1)\nchainloader +1\n```\n\n"

Refer to Finding GRUB's root to ensure your devices are defined correctly.\n- GRUB must be installed on the MBR (first sector of the hard disk), or the first partition of the first storage device to be recognized by most BIOSes. To allow individual distributions the ability to manage their own GRUB menus, multiple instances of GRUB can be used, see #chainloader and configfile.\n- Installing GRUB may need to be done from within a chrooted environment (i.e. from installed environment via a separate medium) for cases like RAID configurations or if you forgot/broke your GRUB installation. You will need to Change root from a LiveCD or another Linux installation to do so.\n\nFirst, enter the GRUB shell:\n\n```\n# grub\n```\n\nUse the root command with the output from the find command (see #Finding GRUB's root) to instruct GRUB which partition contains stage1 (and therefore, /boot):\n\n```\ngrub> root (hd1,0)\n```\n\n"

Commonly, users who manipulate their partitions with GParted -- particularly logical drives -- can cause the order of the partitions to change. For example, you delete /dev/sda6 and resize /dev/sda7, then finally re-create what used to be /dev/sda6 only now it appears at the bottom of the list, /dev/sda9 for example. Although the physical order of the partitions/logical drives has not changed, the order in which they are recognized has changed.\n\nFixing the partition table is easy. Boot from your Arch CD/DVD/USB, login as root and fix the partition table:\n\n```\n# fdisk /dev/sda\n```\n\nOnce in disk, enter e[x]tra/expert mode, [f]ix the partition order, then [w]rite the table and exit.\n\nYou can verify that the partition table was indeed fixed by issuing an fdisk -l. Now you just need to fix GRUB. See #Boot loader installation.\n\nBasically you need to tell GRUB the correct location of your /boot then re-write GRUB to the MBR on the disk.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n# grub\n```\n\n```\ngrub> root (hd0,6)\ngrub> setup (hd0)\ngrub> quit\n```\n\nSee [1] for a more in-depth summary of this section.\n\n"

      "content": "If you see this error message while trying to set up GRUB, and you are not using a fresh partition table, it is worth checking it.\n\n```\n# fdisk -l /dev/sda\n```\n\nThis will show you the partition table for /dev/sda. So check here, whether the \"Id\" values of your partitions are correct. The \"System\" column will show you the description of the \"Id\" values.\n\nIf your boot partition is marked as being \"HPFS/NTFS\", for example, then you have to change it to \"Linux\". To do this, go to fdisk,\n\n```\n# fdisk /dev/sda\n```\n\nchange a partition's system id with t, select your partition number and type in the new system id (Linux = 83). You can also list all available system ids by typing L instead of a system id.\n\nIf you have changed a partitions system id, you should [v]erify your partition table and then [w]rite it.\n\nNow try to set up GRUB again.\n\nSee also the forum post reporting this problem.\n\n"

      "content": "If you accidentally install GRUB to a Windows partition, GRUB will write some information to the boot sector of the partition, erasing the reference to the Windows boot loader. (This is true for NTLDR the boot loader for Windows XP and earlier, unsure about later versions).\n\nTo fix this you will need to use the Windows Recovery Console for your Windows release. Because many computer manufacturers do not include this with their product (many choose to use a recovery partition) Microsoft has made them available for download. If you use XP, look at this page to be able to turn the floppy disks to a Recovery CD. Boot the Recovery CD (or enable Windows Recovery mode) and run fixboot to repair the partition boot sector. After this, you will have to install GRUB again---this time, to the MBR, not to the Windows partition---to boot Linux.\n\nSee Dual boot with Windows#Restoring a Windows boot record for more information.\n\n"

      "content": "I had trouble installing GRUB while installing Arch Linux in an virtual KVM machine using a virtio device for hard drive. To install GRUB, I figured out the following: Enter a virtual console by typing Ctrl+Alt+F2 or any other F-key for a free virtual console. This assumes that your root file system is mounted in the folder /mnt and the boot file system is either mounted or stored in the folder /mnt/boot.\n\n1. Assure that all needed GRUB files is present in your boot directory (assuming it is mounted in /mnt/boot folder), by issuing the command:\n\n```\n# ls /mnt/boot/grub\n```\n\n2. If the /mnt/boot/grub folder already contains all the needed files, jump to step 3. Otherwise, do the following commands (replacing /mnt, your_kernel and your_initrd with the real paths and file names). You should also have the menu.lst file written to this folder:\n\n```\n# mkdir -p /mnt/boot/grub                # if the folder is not yet present\n# cp -r /boot/grub/stage1 /boot/grub/stage2 /mnt/boot/grub\n# cp -r your_kernel your_initrd /mnt/boot\n```\n\n3. Start the GRUB shell with the following command:\n\n```\n# grub --device-map=/dev/null\n```\n\n4. Enter the following commands. Replace /dev/vda, and (hd0,0) with the correct device and partition corresponding to your setup.\n\n```\ndevice (hd0) /dev/vda\nroot (hd0,0)\nsetup (hd0)\nquit\n```\n\n5. If GRUB reports no error messages, then you probably are done. You also need to add appropriate modules to the ramdisk. For more information, please refer to QEMU#Preparing an Arch Linux guest.\n\n"
