This article will show how to install Arch using Bcache as the root partition. For an intro to bcache itself, see the bcache homepage. Be sure to read and reference the bcache manual.\n\nBcache needs the backing device to be formatted as a bcache block device. In most cases, blocks to-bcache can do an in-place conversion.\n\nNote: **This article or section is out of date.** This article or section is out of date.\n\nThis article or section is out of date.\n\n- Be sure you back up any important data first.\n- Bcache and btrfs could leave you with a corrupted filesystem.

Format the backing device (This will typically be your mechanical drive). The backing device can be a whole device, a partition or any other standard block device. This will create /dev/bcache0\n\n```\n# make-bcache -B /dev/sdv1\n```\n\n2. Format the cache device (This will typically be your SSD). The cache device can be a whole device, a partition or any other standard block device\n\n```\n# make-bcache -C /dev/sdk1\n```\n\nIn this example the default block and bucket sizes of 512B and 128kB are used. The block size should match the backing devices sector size which will usually be either 512 or 4k. The bucket size should match the erase block size of the caching device with the intent of reducing write amplification. For example, using a HDD with 4k sectors and an SSD with an erase block size of 2MB this command would look like\n\n```\n# make-bcache --block 4k --bucket 2M -C /dev/sdk1\n```\n\n3. Get the uuid of the cache device\n\n```\n# bcache-super-show /dev/sdk1 | grep cset\ncset.uuid\t\tf0e01318-f4fd-4fab-abbb-d76d870503ec\n```\n\n4. Register the cache device against your backing device. Replace the example uuid with the uuid of your cache. Udev rules will take care of this on reboot and will only need to be done once.\n\n```\n# echo f0e01318-f4fd-4fab-abbb-d76d870503ec > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/attach\n```\n\n5. Create the btrfs filesystem.\n\n```\n# mkfs.btrfs /dev/bcache0\n```\n\n6. mount the filesystem\n\n```\n# mount /dev/bcache0 /mnt\n```\n\n7. If you want to have this partition available during the initcpio (i.e. you require it at some point in the boot process) you need to add 'bcache' to your modules array in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf as well as adding the 'bcache' hook in your list between block and filesystems. You must then regenerate the initramfs.\n\n"

Configure your HDD as a bcache backing device.\n\n```\n# make-bcache -B /dev/sda3\n```\n\n- When preparing any boot disk it is important to know the ramifications of any decision you may make. Please review and review again the documentation for your chosen boot-loader/-manager and consider seriously how it might relate to bcache.\n- If all associated disks are partitioned at once as below bcache will automatically attach \"-B backing stores\" to the \"-C ssd cache\" and step 5 is unnecessary.\n\n```\n# make-bcache -B /dev/sd? /dev/sd? -C /dev/sd?\n```\n\nYou now have a /dev/bcache0 device.\n\n5.

Format the bcache device. Use LVM or btrfs subvolumes if you want to divide up the /dev/bcache0 device how you like (ex for separate /, /home, /var, etc):\n\n```\n# mkfs.btrfs /dev/bcache0\n# mount /dev/bcache0 /mnt/\n# btrfs subvolume create /mnt/root\n# btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home\n# umount /mnt\n```\n\nYou can even setup LUKS on it if you want using e.g. cryptsetup. Referencing the bcache device in the 'cryptdevice' kernel option will work fine, for instance.\n\n7. Prepare the installation mount point:\n\n```\n# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2\n# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1\n```\n\nNow install arch-install-scripts package. Then:\n\n```\n# mount /dev/bcache0 -o subvol=root,compress=lzo /mnt/\n# mount --mkdir /dev/bcache0 -o subvol=home,compress=lzo /mnt/home\n# mount --mkdir /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot\n# mount --mkdir /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi\n```\n\n8.

This is achieved by absorbing all writes with the SSD. The hard drive is only activated when the SSD is full, or when something is read that's not on the SSD.\n\nEnable the writeback cache mode:\n\n```\n# echo writeback > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/cache_mode\n```\n\nLet bcache completely sync with the hard drive.\n\n```\n# echo 0 > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/writeback_percent\n```\n\nDon't let sequential IO bypass the cache:\n\n```\n# echo 0 > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/sequential_cutoff\n```\n\nLet bcache wait a week after the previous sync is done:\n\n```\n# echo $((7*24*60*60)) > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/writeback_delay\n```\n\nDon't let bcache go around the cache when there's read / write congestion\n\n```\n# echo 0 > /sys/fs/bcache/<cache set>/congested_read_threshold_us\n# echo 0 > /sys/fs/bcache/<cache set>/congested_write_threshold_us\n```\n\nPut the HDD to sleep after 20 minutes:\n\n```\n# hdparm -S 240  /dev/$(cat /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/backing_dev_name)\n/dev/sdh1:\nsetting standby to 240 (20 minutes)\n```\n\n```\nFirst use lsblk to get the device names of the HDD and SSD. In this example /dev/sdh1 is the HDD, /dev/sdc1 is the SSD:\n```\n\n```\n# lsblk -M -s\nbcache0   254:0    0 931.5G  0 disk \n   ├─sdc1      8:33   0 111.8G  0 part \n   │ └─sdc     8:32   0 111.8G  0 disk \n   └─sdh1      8:113  0 931.5G  0 part \n     └─sdh     8:112  0 931.5G  0 disk\n```\n\nNow Dstat can be used to monitor disk access to the members of the bcache set.\n\n```\n$ dstat -D sdc1,sdh1\n```\n\n"

Shrink the mounted filesystem by something more than the desired amount, to ensure we do not accidentally clip it later.

When in \"writeback\" mode, the /dev/bcache0 device is not started until the cache device is both registered and attached. Registering is something that needs to happen every bootup, but attaching should only have to be done once.\n\nTo continue booting, try one of the following:\n\n- Register both the backing device and the caching device\n\n```\n# echo /dev/sda3 > /sys/fs/bcache/register\n# echo /dev/sdb > /sys/fs/bcache/register\n```\n\nIf the /dev/bcache0 device now exists, type exit and continue booting. You will need to fix your initcpio to ensure devices are registered before mounting the root device.\n\n- An error of \"sh: echo: write error: Invalid argument\" means the device was already registered or is not recognized as either a bcache backing device or cache. If using the udev rule on boot it should only attempt to register a device if it finds a bcache superblock\n- This can also happen if using udev's 69-bcache.rules in Installation's step 7 and blkid and bcache-probe \"disagree\" due to rogue superblocks. See bcache's wiki for a possible explanation/resolution.\n\n- Re-attach the cache to the backing device:\n\nIf the cache device was registered, a folder with the UUID of the cache should exist in /sys/fs/bcache. Use that UUID when following the example below:\n\n```\n# ls /sys/fs/bcache/\n```\n\n```\nb6b2d82b-f87e-44d5-bbc5-c51dd7aace15     register     register_quiet\n```\n\n```\n# echo b6b2d82b-f87e-44d5-bbc5-c51dd7aace15 > /sys/block/sda/sda3/bcache/attach\n```\n\nIf the /dev/bcache0 device now exists, type exit and continue booting. You should not have to do this again. If it persists, ask on the bcache mailing list.\n\n- Invalidate the cache and force the backing device to run without it. You might want to check some stats, such as \"dirty_data\" so you have some idea of how much data will be lost.\n\n```\n# cat /sys/block/sda/sda3/bcache/dirty_data\n```\n\n```\n-3.9M\n```\n\ndirty data is data in the cache that has not been written to the backing device. If you force the backing device to run, this data will be lost, even if you later re-attach the cache.\n\n```\n# cat /sys/block/sda/sda3/bcache/running\n```\n\n```\n0\n```\n\n```\n# echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/sda3/bcache/running\n```\n\nThe /dev/bcache0 device will now exist. Type exit and continue booting. You might want to unregister the cache device and run make-bcache again. An fsck on /dev/bcache0 would also be wise. See the bcache documentation.\n\n"
