Then create a textfile and add lines in the following format: keycode 173 = XF86AudioPrev. Replace the keycode (173) with your own keycode for the Previous key. Repeat the process for the other keys, substituting 'Prev' for 'Next', 'Play', 'Stop', and 'Mute'.\n\nThen edit ~/.xinitrc and add the line xmodmap <file name> prior to the 'exec' command (if there is one) for the DE/WM, where <file name> is the path to the text file created above.\n\nFinally, in Exaile, go to Edit > Preferences > Plugins, and enable the XKeys plugin. After a restart, multimedia keys should work.\n\n"

You can fix this by running\n\n```\n$ killall npviewer.bin\n```\n\nIn certain cases (such as if a YouTube video has finished playing), Flash may be blocking the use of ALSA even if an 'npviewer.bin' process is not running. In that case, refreshing the offending page while using a Flash blocking browser extension should fix the problem.\n\n"
