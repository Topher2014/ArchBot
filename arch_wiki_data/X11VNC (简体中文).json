While it is not developed any longer by its original author Karl Runge, LibVNC and x11vnc's community on GitHub have taken over the development.\n\nx11vnc, unlike xvnc of TigerVNC, by default, connects to an existing X display. However, one can use -create option to launch and connect to a new headless (virtual) X server.\n\nAlso note that x11vnc is not shipped with a VNC client (VNC viewer). Any VNC viewer should do the job and be compatible with the x11vnc server while not necessarily using all its functionalities. TigerVNC's vncviewer is a recommended client.\n\n"

You can also use a headless X display too.\n\nThen, run the following command, all available options are explained in x11vnc(1).\n\n```\n$ x11vnc\n```\n\nBy default, x11vnc tries to connect to the X display provided by -display option, or environment's DISPLAY variable's value otherwise, or to the :0 display if neither of the earlier are provided.\n\n```\n$ x11vnc -display :1\n```\n\nAnother option is to place the x11vnc command line in a script which is called at login, for example:\n\n```\nx11vnc -wait 50 -noxdamage -passwd PASSWORD -display :0 -forever -o /var/log/x11vnc.log -bg\n```\n\n-wait option sets the time in milliseconds to pause between each poll from the X server's frame buffer.\n\n-noxdamage option disables X Damage extension. See #Session closes unexpectedly.\n\n-forever option keeps x11vnc server up, listening for further client connection, even after the first client disconnected. See #Persistent x11vnc server.\n\n"

If none of these files can be located, it prompts the user for a password, which is saved in ~/.vnc/passwd and is used right away.\n\nThe VNC viewer should then prompt for a password when connecting.\n\n-showrfbauth, -rfbauth and -storepasswd options allow one to see, use or set the RFB's authentication password, respectively.\n\n-passwdfile option can be used to provide a LibVNCServer password file which allows one to set multiple passwords and also passwords for view only connections.\n\n"

For example:\n\n```\n$ x11vnc -display :3 -N\n```\n\nThat will result to using port number 5903 for this VNC server.\n\n-autoport n argument, sets port to the first free port from number n.\n\n-rfbport n argument can be used to set the VNC port explicitly to n.\n\nIn all three cases above, an additional port with the same number will be used for IPv6 connections; aside a 5900 IPv6 port, which also will be used if free. So you will end up with three open ports for that x11vnc server, one for IPv4 and two for IPv6. For example:\n\n```\n$ x11vnc -display :2 -rfbport 5905\n```\n\nThat will connect to X server of display number 2 and listen to IPv4 port 5905 and IPv6 ports 5905 and 5900 for VNC client connections.\n\nFor setting IPv6 port directly, use -rfbportv6 n option.\n\n"

To fix this, we need to create another systemd service that will start another x11vnc server in the GNOME Shell session as soon as you log in:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/x11vnc-gnome-shell-YOUR_USER.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=x11vnc server for Gnome shell session of your_user\n\n[Service]\nUser=YOUR_USER\nType=simple\nExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'while ! pgrep -U \"your_user\" Xorg; do sleep 2; done'\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'sudo systemctl stop x11vnc-gdm.service && /usr/bin/x11vnc -many -shared -display :1 -auth user_home/.Xauthority -rfbauth user_home/.vnc/passwd'\nRestart=on-failure\nRestartSec=3\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=graphical.target\n```\n\nNow, you need to keep the following in mind:\n\n1. As you may notice in the ExecStart part of the systemd service, the command that executes can be separated in two tasks: first it stops x11vnc-gdm.service (killing the GDM x11vnc server) and then it starts the x11vnc server for the user in the GNOME shell session. This is done because if you keep running the GDM x11vnc server in the background, the new x11vnc server for the user will use the next available port, and you would need to change your client connection settings to connect either to the GDM x11vnc server or for your user-specific x11vnc server. A setup like this is useful because the GDM x11vnc server stops as soon as you log in into your account.\n1. You need to create a service like this for each user that you want to have this functionality. (Do not forget to replace your_user and user_home with your actual username.)\n1. You may need to change the -display :X part of the command to match your system settings. You can view your current display by running echo $DISPLAY. Use the resulting output to match the systemd service.\n\nNow, as you might notice, x11vnc-gnome-shell.service is executed as your (probably) unprivileged user. This presents a problem if we want to stop the x11vnc-gdm.service, so we need to allow the user to stop the GDM service. This can be accomplished using sudo, but we need to allow the execution of only that specific command without a password.\n\nEdit the sudoers file to add:\n\n```\nYOUR_USER ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl stop x11vnc-gdm.service\n```\n\nNow you simply need to enable x11vnc-gdm.service and x11vnc-gnome-shell-your_user.service.
