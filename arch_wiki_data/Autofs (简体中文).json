      "content": "Note: **This article or section needs expansion.** This article or section needs expansion.\n\nThis article or section needs expansion.\n\nAutoFS uses template files for configuration which are located in /etc/autofs The main template is called auto.master, which can point to one or more other templates for specific media types.\n\nOpen the file /etc/autofs/auto.master with your favorite editor, you will see something similar to this:\n\n```\n/etc/autofs/auto.master\n```\n\n```\n#/media /etc/autofs/auto.media\n```\n\nThe first value on each line determines the base directory under which all the media in a template are mounted, the second value is which template to use. The default base path is /media, but you can change this to any other location you prefer. For instance:\n\n```\n/etc/autofs/auto.master\n```\n\n```\n/media/misc     /etc/autofs/auto.misc     --timeout=5\n/media/net      /etc/autofs/auto.net      --timeout=60\n```\n\nThe base directory will be created if it does not exist on your system. The base directory will be mounted on to load the dynamically loaded media, which means any content in the base directory will not be accessible while autofs is on. This procedure is however non-destructive, so if you accidentally automount into a live directory you can just change the location in auto.master and restart AutoFS to regain the original contents.\n\nIf you still want to automount to a target non-empty directory and want to have the original files available even after the dynamically loaded directories are mounted, you can use autofs to mount them to another directory (e.g. /var/autofs/net) and create soft links.\n\n```\n# ln -s /var/autofs/net/share_name /media/share_name\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can have autofs mount your media to a specific folder, rather than inside a common folder.\n\n```\n/etc/autofs/auto.master\n```\n\n```\n/-     /etc/autofs/auto.template\n```\n\n```\n/etc/autofs/auto.template\n```\n\n```\n/path/to/folder     -options :/device/path\n/home/user/usbstick  -fstype=auto,async,nodev,nosuid,umask=000  :/dev/sdb1\n```\n\nOpen the file /etc/nsswitch.conf and add an entry for automount:\n\n```\nautomount: files\n```\n\nWhen you are done configuring your templates (see below), launch the AutoFS daemon as root by enabling and starting the autofs.service.\n\nDevices are now automatically mounted when they are accessed, they will remain mounted as long as you access them.\n\n"

      "content": "Removable devices are assigned block device locations according to the next available spot, e.g. if /dev/sd{a,b,c} are already occupied, the next removable media will be given block /dev/sdd. Instead of assigning a mount point based on an unreliable block device path, a more robust approach is to use the UUID or PARTUUID of the removable media as the location in the map file.\n\nFor example, to mount a specific USB drive to the path /mnt/black, configure the template file and map file:\n\n```\n/etc/autofs/auto.master\n```\n\n```\n# master template file\n/mnt     /etc/autofs/auto.mnt   # [options here]\n```\n\nUse blkid to find the UUID of the partition to mount, then generate the map file:\n\n```\n# _ID=$( blkid --output value --match-tag PARTUUID /dev/sdXY )\n# printf \"%s %s\\n\" \"black -fstype=auto :PARTUUID=\" \"${_ID}\" >/etc/autofs/auto.mnt\n```\n\n"

To enable automatic discovery and mounting of network shares from all accessible servers without any further configuration, you will need to add the following to the /etc/autofs/auto.master file:\n\n```\n/net -hosts --timeout=60\n```\n\nFor instance, if you have a remote server fileserver (the name of the directory is the hostname of the server) with an NFS share named /home/share, you can just access the share by typing:\n\n```\n# cd /net/fileserver/home/share\n```\n\nThe -hosts option uses a similar mechanism as the showmount command to detect remote shares. You can see the exported shares by typing:\n\n```\n# showmount servername -e\n```\n\n"
