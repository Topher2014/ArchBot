      "title": "Note for multi-monitor setups",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The example bspwmrc configures ten desktops on one monitor like this:\n\n```\nbspc monitor -d I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X\n```\n\nYou will need to change this line and add one for each monitor, similar to this:\n\n```\nbspc monitor DVI-I-1 -d I II III IV\nbspc monitor DVI-I-2 -d V VI VII\nbspc monitor DP-1 -d VIII IX X\n```\n\nYou can use xrandr -q or bspc query -M --names to find the monitor names. Note that if monitor names contain special characters, the entire name needs to be escaped by a percentage sign bspc monitor %DVI-I-1.5 -d I II III IV to get identified correctly.\n\nThe total number of desktops were maintained at ten in the above example. To address each desktop, you should refer to the exact desktop names (defined by the bspc monitor command above) in your sxhkdrc like this:\n\n```\n# focus or send to the given desktop\nalt + {_,shift + }{1-9,0}\n    bspc {desktop --focus,node --to-desktop} '{I,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX,X}'\n```\n\nNote: In default config, sxhkd refers to desktops by number. But those change each time the monitor setup is changed.\n\nDesktops in bspwm are activated by their index. Unless explicitly set, bspwm will automatically choose the display order, which determines the desktop index. If you encounter issues with desktops being on the wrong display, you should explicitly set the display order. similar to this:\n\n```\nbspc wm -O DVI-I-1 DVI-I-2 DP-1\n\nbspc monitor DVI-I-1 -d I II III IV\nbspc monitor DVI-I-2 -d V VI VII\nbspc monitor DP-1 -d VIII IX X\n```\n\nIf you want to automate your monitor-screens setup in case you periodically change monitor layouts, you need to use a conditional structure to check if a specific monitor is connected and configure it appropriately; you can place the following script in place of the standard bspc monitor -d I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X command:\n\n```\nif [[ $(xrandr -q | grep \"DP-1 connected\") ]];\n   then\n      xrandr --output DP-1  --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0  --rotate normal \\\n             --output DVI-I-1 --off \\\n             --output DVI-I-2 --off \n      bspc monitor DP-1 -d I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\n   fi\n```\n\nThe previous script uses xrandr to set the virtual display configuration and bspc to assign the appropriate desktops layout.\n\nNote that you should first set your preferred monitor layout with arandr, then export the xrandr configuration script and then copy the contents inside the script in place of the xrandr command.\n\n"

Install xorg-xprop.\n1. Run xprop | grep WM_CLASS.\n1. Click on the window of interest to indicate it to xprop.\n1. Record the second string from the output of the command.\n\nThere are two ways to configure window rules (as of cd97a32).\n\nThe first is by using the built in rule command, as shown in the example bspwmrc:\n\n```\nbspc rule -a Gimp desktop=^8 follow=on state=floating\nbspc rule -a Chromium desktop=^2\nbspc rule -a mplayer2 state=floating\nbspc rule -a Kupfer.py focus=on\nbspc rule -a Screenkey manage=off\n```\n\nThe second option is to use an external rule command. This is more complex, but can allow you to craft more complex window rules. See these examples for a sample rule command.\n\n"

The panel will be executed by placing panel & in your bspwmrc. Check the optdepends in the bspwm package for dependencies that may be required.\n\nTo display system information on your status bar you can use various system calls. This example will show you how to edit your panel to get the volume status on your BAR:\n\n```\npanel_volume()\n{\n        volStatus=$(amixer get Master | tail -n 1 | cut -d '[' -f 4 | sed 's/].*//g')\n        volLevel=$(amixer get Master | tail -n 1 | cut -d '[' -f 2 | sed 's/%.*//g')\n        # is alsa muted or not muted?\n        if [ \"$volStatus\" == \"on\" ]\n        then\n                echo \"%{Fyellowgreen} $volLevel %{F-}\"\n        else\n                # If it is muted, make the font red\n                echo \"%{Findianred} $volLevel %{F-}\"\n        fi\n}\n```\n\nNext, we will have to make sure it is called and redirected to $PANEL_FIFO:\n\n```\nwhile true; do\necho \"S\" \"$(panel_volume) $(panel_clock)\" > \"$PANEL_FIFO\"\n        sleep 1s\ndone &\n```\n\n"
