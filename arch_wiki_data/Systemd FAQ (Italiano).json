      "content": "You must set the kernel loglevel yourself. Historically, /etc/rc.sysinit did this for us and set dmesg's loglevel to 3, which was a reasonably quiet loglevel. Either add loglevel=3 or quiet to your kernel parameters.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Currently, only one getty is launched by default. If you switch to another TTY, a getty will be launched there (socket-activation style). In other words, Ctl+Alt+F2 will launch a new getty on tty2.\n\nBy default, the number of auto-activated gettys is capped at six. Thus F7 through F12 will not launch a getty.\n\nIf you want to change this behavior, then edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and change the value of NAutoVTs. If you want all Fx keys to start a getty, increase the value of NAutoVTs to 12. If you are forwarding journald to tty12, increase the value of NAutoVTs to 11 (thus leaving tty12 free).\n\nYou can also pre-activate gettys which will be running from boot.\n\nTo add another pre-activated getty, enable and start getty@ttyX.service.\n\nTo remove a getty, disable and stop the relevant getty@ttyX.service.\n\nsystemd does not use the /etc/inittab file.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "If you see no output at all in console after the initram message, this means you have the quiet parameter in your kernel line. It is best to remove it, at least the first time you boot with systemd, to see if everything is ok. Then, you will see a list [ OK ] in green or [ FAILED ] in red.\n\nAny messages are logged to the system log and if you want to find out about the status of your system, use systemctl or look at the boot/system log with journalctl.\n\n"

This typically happens when switching from one display manager to another one (for instance GDM to SDDM, which can be enabled with gdm.service and sddm.service, respectively) and the corresponding symlink /etc/systemd/system/display-manager.service already exists.\n\nTo solve this problem, either first disable the relevant display manager before enabling the new one, or use the -f/--force option when enabling the new one to overwrite any existing conflicting symlinks (per systemctl(1) § OPTIONS).\n\n"
