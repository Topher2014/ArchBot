As the requirements may change over time, you should consult the requirements page for DokuWiki for additional details.\n\nIt is strongly recommend to read through the appropriate sections of DokuWiki's security page for your web server. Most popular web servers are covered but there are generic instructions as well.\n\n"

      "content": "The package in the official repositories unpacks DokuWiki at /usr/share/webapps/dokuwiki with the configuration files in /etc/webapps/dokuwiki and the data files in /var/lib/dokuwiki/data. It also changes the ownership of the relevant files to the \"http\" user. This should work fine for most popular web servers as packaged for Arch.\n\n1. Install your web server of choice (e.g. Apache HTTP Server, nginx or lighttpd) and configure it for PHP. As mentioned above, DokuWiki has no need for a database server so you may be able to skip those steps when setting up your web server.\n1. Install the dokuwiki package.\n1. Configure web server for dokuwiki (see section below)\n1. With your web browser of choice, open http://<your-server>/dokuwiki/install.php and continue the installation from there. For nginx the URL is http://<your-server>/install.php.\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to install from tarball, you can read from https://www.dokuwiki.org/Install. Generally the procedure is the same as above. Instead of using pacman, you will need to download the tarball, unpack it to your server's document root (e.g. /srv/http/dokuwiki), and chown to the appropriate user (e.g. \"http\").\n\n"
