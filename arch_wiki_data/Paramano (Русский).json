      "content": "Paramano is a GPL-licensed GTK 3 application that lets you select your cores' governor or frequency from a tray icon and displays information about your battery graphically. Paramano is designed to be desktop-environment-independent so it depends only on GTK 3, a system tray and sudo.\n\n"

The original project was forked and named trayfreq-archlinux with the aim of bringing trayfreq back into functionality.\n\nIt was later renamed to Paramano, initially a nonsense word which turned out to mean 'cuff' in Italian.\n\n"

If you want to have per-user configuration, then create a configuration file in your home directory:\n\n```\n$ cp /etc/paramano.conf ~/.paramano.conf\n```\n\nWithout this, what you change in the next step will be system-wide — it is your choice.\n\nOpen the appropriate configuration file (/etc/paramano.conf or ~/.paramano.conf) with your favourite editor. Everything will be commented out; un-comment what you want to use. Note that, if a default frequency is set, it will override the governor.\n\n"

If you do not want it to start automatically, open the start up manager that comes with your desktop environment and uncheck paramano.\n\nIf paramano does not seem to want to change the governor, it will be because it is detected that it is not running as root and has tried to use sudo to elevate its privileges. However, it requires that it has passwordless access to run /usr/bin/paramano-set. If you have sudo configured such that you type your password to authenticate, you will need to add this line to /etc/sudoers:\n\n```\nyour_user_name ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/paramano-set\n```\n\n"
