It combines a simple binary package format with an easy-to-use Arch build system. The goal of pacman is to make it possible to easily manage packages, whether they are from the official repositories or the user's own builds.\n\nPacman keeps the system up-to-date by synchronizing package lists with the master server. This server/client model also allows the user to download/install packages with a simple command, complete with all required dependencies.\n\nPacman is written in the C programming language and uses the bsdtar(1) tar format for packaging.\n\n"

      "content": "A package is an archive containing:\n\n- all of the (compiled) files of an application\n- metadata about the application, such as application name, version, dependencies, etc.\n- installation files and directives for pacman\n\nArch's package manager pacman can install, update, and remove those packages. Using packages instead of compiling and installing programs yourself has various benefits:\n\n- easily updatable: pacman will update existing packages as soon as updates are available\n- dependency checks: pacman handles dependencies for you, you only need to specify the program and pacman installs it together with every other program it needs\n- clean removal: pacman has a list of every file in a package; this way, no files are unintentionally left behind when you decide to remove a package.\n\n- Packages often have optional dependencies which are packages that provide additional functionality to the application but not strictly required for running it. When installing a package, pacman will list a package's optional dependencies, but they will not be found in pacman.log. Use the #Querying package databases command to view the optional dependencies of a package.\n- When installing a package which you require only as a (optional) dependency of some other package (i.e. not required by you explicitly), it is recommended to use the --asdeps option. For details, see the #Installation reason section.\n\nNote: **not** \n\n"

To install the version from the extra repository in this example, the repository needs to be defined in front of the package name:\n\n```\n# pacman -S extra/package_name\n```\n\nTo install a number of packages sharing similar patterns in their names, one can use curly brace expansion. For example:\n\n```\n# pacman -S plasma-{desktop,mediacenter,nm}\n```\n\nThis can be expanded to however many levels needed:\n\n```\n# pacman -S plasma-{workspace{,-wallpapers},pa}\n```\n\nA virtual package is a special package which does not exist by itself, but is provided by one or more other packages. Virtual packages allow other packages to not name a specific package as a dependency, in case there are several candidates. Virtual packages cannot be installed by their name, instead they become installed in your system when you have installed a package providing the virtual package. An example is the dbus-units package.\n\n"

Instead of having to enter all the numbers except the ones you do not want, it is sometimes more convenient to select or exclude packages or ranges of packages with the following syntax:\n\n```\nEnter a selection (default=all): 1-10 15\n```\n\nwhich will select packages 1 through 10 and 15 for installation, or:\n\n```\nEnter a selection (default=all): ^5-8 ^2\n```\n\nwhich will select all packages except 5 through 8 and 2 for installation.\n\nTo see what packages belong to the gnome group, run:\n\n```\n$ pacman -Sg gnome\n```\n\nAlso visit https://archlinux.org/groups/ to see what package groups are available.\n\n"

It allows to downgrade a package without the need to retrieve the previous version through other means, such as the Arch Linux Archive.\n1. A package that has been uninstalled can easily be reinstalled directly from the cache directory, not requiring a new download from the repository.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to deliberately clean up the cache periodically to prevent the directory to grow indefinitely in size.\n\nThe paccache(8) script, provided within the pacman-contrib package, deletes all cached versions of installed and uninstalled packages, except for the most recent three, by default:\n\n```\n# paccache -r\n```\n\nEnable and start paccache.timer to discard unused packages weekly. You can configure the arguments for the service in /etc/conf.d/pacman-contrib, e.g with PACCACHE_ARGS='-k1' or PACCACHE_ARGS='-uk0' for the two examples below.\n\nYou can also define how many recent versions you want to keep. To retain only one past version use:\n\n```\n# paccache -rk1\n```\n\nAdd the -u/--uninstalled switch to limit the action of paccache to uninstalled packages. For example to remove all cached versions of uninstalled packages, use the following:\n\n```\n# paccache -ruk0\n```\n\nSee paccache -h for more options.\n\nPacman also has some built-in options to clean the cache and the leftover database files from repositories which are no longer listed in the configuration file /etc/pacman.conf. However pacman does not offer the possibility to keep a number of past versions and is therefore more aggressive than paccache default options.\n\nTo remove all the cached packages that are not currently installed, and the unused sync databases, execute:\n\n```\n# pacman -Sc\n```\n\nTo remove all files from the cache, use the clean switch twice, this is the most aggressive approach and will leave nothing in the cache directory:\n\n```\n# pacman -Scc\n```\n\npkgcachecleanAUR and pacleanerAUR are two further alternatives to clean the cache.\n\n"

This is by design, not a flaw.\n\nThe problem is usually trivial to solve (although to be sure, you should try to find out how these files got there in the first place). A safe way is to first check if another package owns the file (pacman -Qo /path/to/file). If the file is owned by another package, file a bug report. If the file is not owned by another package, rename the file which \"exists in filesystem\" and re-issue the update command. If all goes well, the file may then be removed.\n\nIf you had installed a program manually without using pacman, for example through make install, you have to remove/uninstall this program with all of its files. See also Pacman tips#Identify files not owned by any package.\n\nEvery installed package provides a /var/lib/pacman/local/package-version/files file that contains metadata about this package. If this file gets corrupted, is empty or goes missing, it results in file exists in filesystem errors when trying to update the package. Such an error usually concerns only one package.

Reinstall these packages with pacman -S --overwrite to update the package database accordingly\n1. Do a full system upgrade\n\nIf you have a healthy Arch system on hand, you can see the full list of dependencies with:\n\n```\n$ pacman -Q $(pactree -u pacman)\n```\n\nBut you may only need to update a few of them depending on your issue. An example of extracting a package is\n\n```\n# tar -xvpwf package.tar.zst -C / --exclude .PKGINFO --exclude .INSTALL --exclude .MTREE --exclude .BUILDINFO\n```\n\nNote the use of the w flag for interactive mode. Running non-interactively is very risky since you might end up overwriting an important file. Also take care to extract packages in the correct order (i.e. dependencies first). This forum post contains an example of this process where only a couple pacman dependencies are broken.\n\n"

Then chroot using arch-chroot:\n\n```\n# arch-chroot /mnt\n# pacman -Syu mkinitcpio systemd linux\n```\n\n- If you do not have a current release or if you only have some other \"live\" Linux distribution laying around, you can chroot using the old fashioned way. Obviously, there will be more typing than simply running the arch-chroot script.\n- If pacman fails with Could not resolve host, please check your internet connection.\n- If you cannot enter the arch-chroot or chroot environment but need to re-install packages, you can use the command pacman --sysroot /mnt -Syu foo bar to use pacman on your root partition.\n\nReinstalling the kernel (the linux package) will automatically re-generate the initramfs image with mkinitcpio -p linux.
