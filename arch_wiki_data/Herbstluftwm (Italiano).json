Autostart is called on each reload, therefore within autostart you typically unmap all existing configuration first.\n\n"

It brings a lot of flexibility and gives the user more control over their monitor-arrangement. You can use herbstclient detect_monitors to automatically adapt to the physical setup. Otherwise, see the manpage on how to add, remove, resize and move monitors. Tags in a multi-monitor set-up are not \"owned\" by a monitor. This means that when one monitor switches to a tag that is active in another monitor, the two monitors will swap tags.\n\n"

Try herbstclient list_commands to show all parameters.\n\nRight now there is no error message if you use wrong parameters on a command, but only a non-zero return value. If you do not show the return value of a command anyway (e.g. in your $SHELL-prompt), you might want to echo $? to find the return value of the last command.\n\n"
