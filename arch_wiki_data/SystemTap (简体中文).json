However, see stapprobes(3) for the NON-DWARF and AUTO-DWARF probe types for what should still work, for example:\n\n- kernel tracepoints: kernel.trace(\"*\")\n- user-space probes: process(\"...\").function(\"...\") (for programs you build yourself with -g)\n- user-space markers: process(\"...\").mark(\"...\") (if they were configured with the <sys/sdt.h> markers)\n- perfctr-based probes: perf.*\n- non-dwarf kernel probes: kprobe.function(\"...\") and nd_syscall.* tapset (if a /boot/System.map* file is available, see below).\n\n"

Run makepkg or makepkg --skipchecksums to compile, then simply sudo pacman -U *.pkg.tar.gz to install the packages. pacman will tell you reinstall, and you should say y.\n\nlinux and linux-headers should be reinstalled, linux-docs does not matter.\n\nVia this method, external modules (e.g. nvidia and virtualbox) do not need to be rebuilt.\n\n"
