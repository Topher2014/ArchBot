This is convenient for daemons and other services that are commonly run for a single user, such as mpd, or to perform automated tasks like fetching mail.\n\n"

      "title": "How it works",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "As per default configuration in /etc/pam.d/system-login, the pam_systemd module automatically launches a systemd --user instance when the user logs in for the first time. This process will survive as long as there is some session for that user, and will be killed as soon as the last session for the user is closed. When #Automatic start-up of systemd user instances is enabled, the instance is started on boot and will not be killed. The systemd user instance is responsible for managing user services, which can be used to run daemons or automated tasks with all the benefits of systemd, such as socket activation, timers, dependency system, and strict process control via cgroups.\n\nSimilar to system units, user units are located in the following directories (ordered by ascending precedence):\n\n- /usr/lib/systemd/user/ where units provided by installed packages belong.\n- ~/.local/share/systemd/user/ where units of packages that have been installed in the home directory belong.\n- /etc/systemd/user/ where system-wide user units are placed by the system administrator.\n- ~/.config/systemd/user/ where the user puts their own units.\n\nWhen a systemd user instance starts, it brings up the per user target default.target. Other units can be controlled manually with systemctl --user. See systemd.special(7) § UNITS MANAGED BY THE USER SERVICE MANAGER.\n\n- Be aware that the systemd --user instance is a per-user process, and not per-session. The rationale is that most resources handled by user services, like sockets or state files will be per-user (live on the user's home directory) and not per session. This means that all user services run outside of a session. As a consequence, programs that need to be run inside a session will probably break in user services. The way systemd handles user sessions is pretty much in flux. See [1] and [2] for some hints on where things are going.\n- systemd --user runs as a separate process from the systemd --system process. User units can not reference or depend on system units or units of other users.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Units started by user instance of systemd do not inherit any of the environment variables set in places like .bashrc etc. There are several ways to set environment variables for them:\n\n- For users with a $HOME directory, create a .conf file in the ~/.config/environment.d/ directory with lines of the form NAME=VAL. Affects only that user's user unit. See environment.d(5) for more information.\n- Use the DefaultEnvironment option in /etc/systemd/user.conf file. Affects all user units.\n- Add a drop-in configuration file in /etc/systemd/system/user@UID.service.d/, see #Service example\n- Add a drop-in configuration file in /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/ (affects all users), see #Service example\n- At any time, use systemctl --user set-environment or systemctl --user import-environment. Affects all user units started after setting the environment variables, but not the units that were already running.\n- Using the dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd --all command provided by dbus. Has the same effect as systemctl --user import-environment, but also affects the D-Bus session. You can add this to the end of your shell initialization file.\n- For \"global\" environment variables for the user environment you can use the environment.d directories which are parsed by some generators. See environment.d(5) and systemd.generator(7) for more information.\n- You can also write a systemd.environment-generator(7) script which can produce environment variables that vary from user to user, this is probably the best way if you need per-user environments (this is the case for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, etc).\n\nOne variable you may want to set is PATH.\n\nAfter configuration, the command systemctl --user show-environment can be used to verify that the values are correct. You may need to run systemctl --user daemon-reload for changes to take effect immediately.\n\n"

      "content": "Alternatively, xorg can be run from within a systemd user service. This is nice since other X-related units can be made to depend on xorg, etc, but on the other hand, it has some drawbacks explained below.\n\nxorg-server provides integration with systemd in two ways:\n\n- Can be run unprivileged, delegating device management to logind (see Hans de Goede commits around this commit).\n- Can be made into a socket activated service (see this commit).\n\nUnfortunately, to be able to run xorg in unprivileged mode, it needs to run inside a session. So, right now the handicap of running xorg as user service is that it must be run with root privileges (like before 1.16), and cannot take advantage of the unprivileged mode introduced in 1.16.\n\nThis is how to launch xorg from a user service:\n\n1. Make xorg run with root privileges for any user, by editing /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config. This builds on Xorg#Xorg as Root by adding the stipulation that this need not be done from a physical console. That is, allowed_user's default of console is being overwritten with anybody; see Xorg.wrap(1).\n\n```\n/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config\n```\n\n```\nallowed_users=anybody\nneeds_root_rights=yes\n```\n\n2. Add the following units to ~/.config/systemd/user\n\n```\n~/.config/systemd/user/xorg@.socket\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Socket for xorg at display %i\n\n[Socket]\nListenStream=/tmp/.X11-unix/X%i\n```\n\n```\n~/.config/systemd/user/xorg@.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Xorg server at display %i\n\nRequires=xorg@%i.socket\nAfter=xorg@%i.socket\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nSuccessExitStatus=0 1\n\nExecStart=/usr/bin/Xorg :%i -nolisten tcp -noreset -verbose 2 \"vt${XDG_VTNR}\"\n```\n\nwhere ${XDG_VTNR} is the virtual terminal where xorg will be launched, either hard-coded in the service unit, or set in the systemd environment with\n\n```\n$ systemctl --user set-environment XDG_VTNR=1\n```\n\n3. Make sure to configure the DISPLAY environment variable as explained above.\n\n4. Then, to enable socket activation for xorg on display 0 and tty 2 one would do:\n\n```\n$ systemctl --user set-environment XDG_VTNR=2     # So that xorg@.service knows which vt use\n$ systemctl --user start xorg@0.socket            # Start listening on the socket for display 0\n```\n\nNow running any X application will launch xorg on virtual terminal 2 automatically.\n\nThe environment variable XDG_VTNR can be set in the systemd environment from .bash_profile, and then one could start any X application, including a window manager, as a systemd unit that depends on xorg@0.socket.\n\n"
