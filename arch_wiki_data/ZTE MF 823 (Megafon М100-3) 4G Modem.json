When they are, you will see that the LED (Blue - 2G/3G or Green - 4G) on modem is not blinking. To establish a connection, the following link (CGI command) should be entered in a browser:\n\nhttp://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process?goformId=CONNECT_NETWORK\n\nTo avoid entering this link every time, switch the device to auto-connection mode:\n\nhttp://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process?goformId=SET_CONNECTION_MODE&ConnectionMode=auto_dial\n\nIf you are setting up internet using a command-line shell you should make request with referrer, as in:\n\n```\ncurl --header \"Referer: http://192.168.0.1/index.html\" http://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process?goformId=CONNECT_NETWORK\n```\n\notherwise you will get response {\"result\":\"faulure\"}\n\n"

Unable to recieve further CGI commands, connection will be lost!), issue this link:\n\n```\nhttp://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_process?goformId=MODE_SWITCH&switchCmd=FACTORY\n```\n\nYou may then need to run the following command (as root) in order to access the AT command serial port:\n\n```\n# echo 0x19d2 0x16 > /sys/module/usbserial/drivers/usb-serial:generic/new_id\n```\n\nThe port should appear as /dev/ttyUSBn, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB1. When you discover the command port, you can use your favourite serial terminal emulation program to control the device. The commands below may be especially useful (here shown with modem-cmd):\n\n```\n# modem-cmd /dev/ttyUSB1 AT+ZCDRUN=8     # switch to 1403 mode (RNDIS)\n# modem-cmd /dev/ttyUSB1 AT+ZCDRUN=9     # switch to 1225 mode (default)\n# modem-cmd /dev/ttyUSB1 AT+ZCDRUN=F     # exit DOWNLOAD mode and switch to selected mode (RNDIS or default)\n```\n\n"

I was unsuccessful in trying to switch modes using usb_modeswitch or sending AT commands to /dev/ttyUSB0 on various Linux systems. I successfully managed to change modes from 0016 to 1403 using Mac OSX. I was then able to use the dongle on Linux.\n\nIn mode 0016 on OSX you will see the follow interfaces:\n\n```\n/dev/tty.ZTEUSBATPort_\n/dev/tty.ZTEUSBModem_\n/dev/tty.ZTEUSBDIAGPort_\n```\n\nYou can switch modes to 1403 by sending AT commands to the USBModem_ port by doing:\n\n```\nscreen /dev/tty.ZTEUSBModem_ 9600\n\n>>ATI\nManufacturer: ZTE CORPORATION\nModel: MF823\nRevision: MF823_T03\nIMEI: 866948013728723\n+GCAP: +CGSM\n\n>>AT+CREG?\n+CREG: 0,1\nOK\n\n>>AT+COPS?\n+COPS: 0,0,\"Telstra Mobile\",7\nOK\n\n>>AT+ZCDRUN=8+AT+ZCDRUN=F\nexit download mode result(0:FAIL 1:SUCCESS):1\nOK\n```\n\nNow the device should act as a ethernet interface no matter which system you plug it into.\n\n"
