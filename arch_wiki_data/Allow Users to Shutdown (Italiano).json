Configuration of the Linux kernel, which interacts with the hardware: Kernel parameters Kernel modules udev rules\n1. Configuration of userspace tools, which interact with the kernel and react to its events. Many userspace tools also allow modification of kernel configuration in a \"user-friendly\" way.

On systems with no dedicated power manager, this may replace the acpid daemon which is usually used to react to these ACPI events.\n\nThe specified action for each event can be one of ignore, poweroff, reboot, halt, suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate, lock or kexec. In case of hibernation and suspension, they must be properly set up. If an event is not configured, systemd will use a default action.\n\nTable content:\nEvent handler | Description | Default action\nHandlePowerKey | Triggered when the power key/button is pressed. | poweroff\nHandleSuspendKey | Triggered when the suspend key/button is pressed. | suspend\nHandleHibernateKey | Triggered when the hibernate key/button is pressed. | hibernate\nHandleLidSwitch | Triggered when the lid is closed, except in the cases below. | suspend\nHandleLidSwitchDocked | Triggered when the lid is closed if the system is inserted in a docking station, or more than one display is connected. | ignore\nHandleLidSwitchExternalPower | Triggered when the lid is closed if the system is connected to external power. | action set for HandleLidSwitch\n\nTo apply changes, reload systemd-logind.service.\n\n- systemd cannot handle AC and Battery ACPI events, so if you use Laptop Mode Tools or other similar tools acpid is still required.\n- When performing lid switches in short succession, logind will delay the suspend action for up to 90s to detect possible docks. [1] This delay was made configurable with systemd v220. [2] You can use e.g. HoldoffTimeoutSec=30s in logind.conf or its drop-in file.\n\n"

The power managers of GNOME, MATE, Plasma and Xfce issue the necessary inhibited commands.

The BIOS determined that needed to happen.\n1. PCIE requires ASPM but L0s is optional so you might have L0s disabled and only L1 enabled.\n1. You have a buggy BIOS.\n1. You have no BIOS and your systems programmers did not address ASPM yet.\n\nIf you believe that your hardware has support for ASPM despite the above, it can be force-enabled for the kernel to handle with the pcie_aspm=force kernel parameter.\n\n- Force-enabling ASPM on an unsupported system may lead to increased power consumption. Furthermore, it may cause system freezes or kernel panics, so make sure you have a way to undo the option if it is unsuitable.\n- Forcing ASPM takes place in the kernel, and therefore it may still remain disabled in hardware and not work. To check whether this is the case, run dmesg | grep ASPM as root. Consult the Wiki article specific to your hardware for more information if possible.\n\nAs long as ASPM is supported and enabled, it is possible to select a desired policy for the current session. For example, switch to powersupersave for the current session by doing the following:\n\n```\n# echo powersupersave > /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy\n```\n\nTo configure a specific ASPM state to enable upon system boot (using powersupersave as an example), add pcie_aspm.policy=powersupersave as a kernel parameter.\n\n"

This can sometimes save quite a bit of power, however some USB devices are not compatible with USB power saving and start to misbehave (common for USB mice/keyboards). udev rules based on whitelist or blacklist filtering can help to mitigate the problem.\n\nThe example is enabling autosuspend for all USB devices except for keyboards and mice:\n\n```\n/etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb_power_save.rules\n```\n\n```\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{product}!=\"*Mouse\", ATTR{product}!=\"*Keyboard\", TEST==\"power/control\", ATTR{power/control}=\"auto\"\n```\n\nTo allow autosuspend only for devices that are known to work, use simple matching against vendor and product IDs (use lsusb to get these values):\n\n```\n/etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb_power_save.rules\n```\n\n```\n# whitelist for usb autosuspend\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", TEST==\"power/control\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"05c6\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"9205\", ATTR{power/control}=\"auto\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, to blacklist devices that are not working with USB autosuspend and enable it for all other devices:\n\n```\n/etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb_power_save.rules\n```\n\n```\n# blacklist for usb autosuspend\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"05c6\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"9205\", GOTO=\"power_usb_rules_end\"\n\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", TEST==\"power/control\", ATTR{power/control}=\"auto\"\nLABEL=\"power_usb_rules_end\"\n```\n\nThe default autosuspend idle delay time is controlled by the autosuspend parameter of the usbcore built-in kernel module. To set the delay to 5 seconds instead of the default 2 seconds, add the following kernel parameter for your boot loader.\n\n```\nusbcore.autosuspend=5\n```\n\nSimilarly to power/control, the delay time can be fine-tuned per device by setting the power/autosuspend attribute.

There is just one thing systemd cannot do (as of systemd-204): power management depending on whether the system is running on AC or battery. To fill this gap, you can create a single udev rule that runs a script when the AC adapter is plugged and unplugged:\n\n```\n/etc/udev/rules.d/powersave.rules\n```\n\n```\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"0\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script true\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"power_supply\", ATTR{online}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/path/to/your/script false\"\n```\n\nExamples of powersave scripts:\n\n- ftw, package: ftw-gitAUR\n- powersave\n- throttlectl, from throttlectlAUR\n\nThe above udev rule should work as expected, but if your power settings are not updated after a suspend or hibernate cycle, you should add a script in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ with the following contents:\n\n```\n/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/00powersave\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1 in\n    pre) /path/to/your/script false ;;\n    post)\n\tif cat /sys/class/power_supply/AC0/online | grep 0 > /dev/null 2>&1\n\tthen\n    \t\t/path/to/your/script true\n\telse\n    \t\t/path/to/your/script false\n\tfi\n    ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n```\n\nDo not forget to make it executable!\n\n"
