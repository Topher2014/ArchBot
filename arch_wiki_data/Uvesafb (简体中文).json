It may seem foolish to emulate x86 code on a x86, but this is important if one wants to use the framebuffer code on other architectures (notably non-x86 ones). It was added in kernel 2.6.24 and has many more features than the standard vesafb, including:\n\n1. Proper blanking and hardware suspension after delay\n1. Support for custom resolutions as in the system BIOS.\n\nIt should support as much hardware as vesafb.\n\n"
