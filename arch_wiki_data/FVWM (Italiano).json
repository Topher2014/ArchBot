Fvwm3 version 1.0.0 was published on 3 September 2020.\n\nFvwm is an ICCCM-compliant multiple virtual desktop window manager for the X Window system. It is configured by editing text-based configuration files. Although using FVWM does not require any knowledge of programming languages, it is possible to extend FVWM with M4, C, and Perl preprocessing. FVWM also has a Perl library which allows one to create modules. FVWM stands for F Virtual Window Manager with the preferred interpretation being that the F does not stand for anything in particular [1].\n\n"

For example, if one wanted to start network-manager-applet on startup (but not for any subsequent restarts of the window manager) one could add the nm-applet command to the InitFunction:\n\n```\nAddToFunc InitFunction\n+ I Exec nm-applet\n```\n\nYou can also use just StartFunction and prepend your commands with Test commands which check whether the window manager has started or restarted and run the action only if the test is true. Using this method, nm-applet could be started in the following manner:\n\n```\nAddToFunc StartFunction\n+ I Test (Init) Exec nm-applet\n```\n\n"

See [2] for a description of the differences between workspaces and viewports. FVWM refers to workspaces as desks and viewports as pages.\n\nPages in FVWM are arranged in a grid. The number of pages used can be defined with the DesktopSize command. For instance, adding DesktopSize 3x3 to your configuration file will give you 9 pages, arranged in a 3x3 grid. Pages can be navigated using the pager module or with the GoToPage command which could be mapped to a keyboard shortcut or menu entry. For instance, the command GoToPage -1p +0p will move the viewport 1 page to the left of the current page.\n\nThe number of desks available in FVWM is very large, the minimum desk number is -2147483648 and the maximum is 2147483647. By default, FVWM starts on desk 0. Desks can be navigated using the pager module (if it is configured to show a number of desks) or with the GoToDesk command - GoToDesk +1 will move to the next desk, relative to the currently used desk.\n\n"

Note that the (window) argument is optional.\n\nThe context value defines where the binding will be applied. The following contexts are valid: R (root window), W (application window), D (desktop manager window - PCManFM desktop manager for instance), T (title bar), S (window side, top, bottom), [ ] - _ (left side, right side, top, bottom respectively), F (window frame corners), < > ^ v (left, right, top, bottom corners respectively), I (icon window), 0-9 (titlebar buttons) and A (all contexts).

Multiple modifiers should not be spaced. For instance, to use the modifier Control+Alt, you would supply as the modifier argument C1.\n\nThe action must be an FVWM function to run, such as the Quit function or Menu function.

This can be useful when using a menu generator, such as one that constructs a menu of applications from XDG desktop entries, and you want the content to always be up to date.\n\nDynamic menus can be created in FVWM by using the DynamicPopUpAction and DynamicPopDownAction keywords. The former can be used to create/recreate the menu when it is opened whilst the latter can be used to clear the menu when it is closed. It is important to note that for a submenu to be dynamic, the parent menu that it is included in must also be created dynamically even if it does not contain any dynamic content.\n\nConsider a hypothetical menu generator called my-menu which generates output of the sort below.\n\n```\nDestroyMenu recreate Submenu1\nAddToMenu Submenu1 \"Submenu 1\" Title\n+ \"Item 1\" Nop\n+ \"Item 2\" Nop\n\nDestroyMenu recreate MyMenu\nAddToMenu MyMenu \"My Menu\" Title\n+ \"Submenu 1\" Popup Submenu1\n```\n\nNote: **all** \n\nNow suppose that we wished to incorporate my-menu into our root menu dynamically. This means that the root menu must also be created dynamically. To accomplish this, we need to define a function that constructs the root menu and a function that calls the dynamic menu generator using the PipeRead command. Then in the menu definitions themselves, DynamicPopUpAction can be used to call those functions. See the example below.\n\n```\nDestroyMenu RootMenu\nAddToMenu RootMenu\n+ DynamicPopUpAction Function CreateRootMenu\n+ DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu recreate RootMenu\n\nDestroyFunc CreateRootMenu\nAddToFunc CreateRootMenu\n+ I DestroyMenu recreate RootMenu\n+ I AddToMenu RootMenu \"Root Menu\" Title\n+ I AddToMenu RootMenu \"My Menu\" PopUp MyMenu\n+ I AddToMenu RootMenu \"XTerm\" Exec xterm\n+ I AddToMenu RootMenu \"Firefox\" Exec firefox\n\nDestroyMenu MyMenu\nAddToMenu MyMenu\n+ DynamicPopUpAction Function CreateMyMenu\n+ DynamicPopDownAction DestroyMenu recreate MyMenu\n\nDestroyFunc CreateMyMenu\nAddToFunc CreateMyMenu\n+ I DestroyMenu recreate MyMenu\n+ I PipeRead 'my-menu'\n```\n\n"

The letter codes stand for the following: I - execute immediately, M - execute when the user moves the mouse, C - execute on mouse click, H - execute when the user holds the mouse button, D - execute when the user double clicks the mouse button. Below is a trivial example of a function:\n\n```\nAddToFunc VolumeFunc\n+ I Exec xterm -e alsamixer\n```\n\nOne can also use conditional commands (see [dead link 2023-10-29 ⓘ] fvwm(1) and look for the Conditional Commands section).

      "content": "FvwmButtons is a module which can create a box of buttons which can perform actions when pressed. FvwmButtons can also \"swallow\" application windows. This might be useful for swallowing a system tray window or a clock window. The size of the panel is automatically determined (the panel will resize to accommodate all elements) however it is also possible to manually set a size using the Geometry command. This takes a standard X geometry. The basic commands needed to create an FvwmButtons panel are outlined below.\n\nSet the number of rows and columns:\n\n```\n*FvwmButtons: Rows x\n*FvwmButtons: Columns x\n```\n\nNote that items are added by filling each row from left to right, from the top row to the bottom one.\n\nCreate a button (this example creates a button with a title and an icon which launches an XTerm when left clicked):\n\n```\n*FvwmButtons: (Title \"Xterm\", Icon /usr/share/pixmaps/mini.xterm_48x48.xpm, Action (Mouse1) Exec xterm)\n```\n\nYou can omit any of these arguments if you so choose.\n\nSwallow a window (this example swallows a stalonetray):\n\n```\n*FvwmButtons: (Swallow(UseOld, NoClose) \"stalonetray\" \"Nop\")\n```\n\nThe Swallow command takes a number of \"hangon\" arguments. Here, the UseOld and NoClose arguments have been used. UseOld means that an existing window will be swallowed if it exists. NoClose means that the window will not be closed if the FvwmButtons process is terminated. The stalonetray argument is the class of the window that we want to swallow. Replace as appropriate. The last argument is a command to start the application that is to be swallowed. In this example, it is assumed that the application has already been started so the argument provided is Nop which is a function that does nothing. One could replace this with \"Exec stalonetray\" to start the application from the FvwmButtons module instead of assuming that the application has been started elsewhere.\n\nContainers are spaces defined which can span multiple rows and columns or subdivide a row or column into more rows or columns. This can be useful for instance if one wants to allocate a certain percentage of space to an element. Say one wants to swallow an XClock and allocate 100% of the width and 80% of the height to the XClock. This can be defined as such:\n\n```\n*FvwmButtons: Rows 5\n*FvwmButtons: Columns 1\n*FvwmButtons: (1x4, Container)\n*FvwmButtons: (Swallow(UseOld, NoClose) \"xclock\" \"Nop\")\n*FvwmButtons: (End)\n```\n\nNote that a container is created by defining a certain number of columns and rows and then using the keyword container. Elements inside the container are defined underneath this line and the container is then closed with the End command.\n\nFor a full list of options, see [dead link 2023-10-29 ⓘ] FvwmButtons(1).\n\n"

      "content": "- Using FvwmEvent allows for a window in a page to be automatically focused when clicking on that page in the FvwmPager. However, it breaks the right-click and drag panning functionality of the pager. For this reason, you might prefer to call GoToPage and Focus-Previous from within another function bound to a hotkey instead of using FvwmEvent.\n- If you are not using ClickToFocus, you will need to temporarily set the focus method to ClickToFocus before the desk switch is initiated. If you do not do this, any window under the pointer in the new desk will immediately receive focus, even if it is not the previously focused window. Note that this means you cannot use the FvwmEvent approach. Instead, create a function that changes the focus method and then calls GoToDesk and Focus-Previous.\n\nIf you are using ClickToFocus, you might wish to automatically transfer keyboard focus when switching pages or desks to the previously focused window in that page or desk. Otherwise, you will have to click on the window you wish to interact with on every page or desk switch. This can be accomplished by using the FvwmEvent module to bind a function which focuses the currently or previous focused window to the new_page and new_desk events.\n\nBelow is an example of such a function:\n\n```\nDestroyFunc Focus-Previous\nAddToFunc Focus-Previous\n+ I All ($0, Focused) FlipFocus $1\n+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Prev ($0, AcceptsFocus) FlipFocus $1\n```\n\nThe $0 argument should be either CurrentPage or CurrentDesk. The $1 argument is for supplying the NoWarp argument to FlipFocus - by default, FlipFocus will initiate a page switch to the page containing the focused window. This behaviour is useful when switching desks but must be disabled when switching pages because windows can span more than one page.\n\nWith the function appropriately configured, ensure that FvwmEvent is started and then bind it to the required events as show below:\n\n```\n* FvwmEvent: new_page \"Focus-Previous CurrentPage NoWarp\"\n* FvwmEvent: new_desk \"Focus-Previous CurrentDesk\"\n```\n\n"

Similarly some windows automatically resize themselves which can also affect their position.\n\nThis is typically due to PPosition (program position) or USPosition (user specified position) hints which applications can set and which FVWM respects by default. For troublesome windows, you can configure FVWM to ignore the hints that are causing the problem. The first step is to get the class name or resource name of the window in question - use the #FvwmIdent module for this. Then try disabling either the PPosition or USPosition hints for the window. For example:\n\n```\nStyle chromium !UsePPosition\n```\n\nFor windows whose position is affected by resizing this can typically be fixed by setting the FixedPPosition style on the window which causes FVWM to ignore attempts by the window to change its position. This can be set in conjunction with ignoring USPosition hints if necessary, see below:\n\n```\nStyle VirtualBox !UseUSPosition, FixedPPosition\n```\n\n"
