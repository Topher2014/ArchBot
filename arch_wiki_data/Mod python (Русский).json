WSGI is one of the Python ways to produce high quality and high performance web applications.\n\nWSGI provide a standard way to interface different web-apps without hassle. Several well-know python applications or frameworks provide wsgi for easy deployment and embedding. It means that you can embed your Django-powered blog and your project's Trac into a single Pylons application that wraps around them to deals with, say, authentication without modifying the formers.\n\nExample:\n\n- Pylons\n- Django\n- Turbo-gear\n- Trac\n- Moin-moin\n- Zope\n\n"
