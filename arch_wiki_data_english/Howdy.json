The following line must be added to any configuration file:\n\n```\nauth sufficient pam_python.so /lib/security/howdy/pam.py\n```\n\nNote: When using Howdy 3.0.0 BETA and above (howdy-beta-gitAUR), the line should be:\n\n```\nauth sufficient /lib/security/pam_howdy.so\n```\n\nAdding howdy/pam.py (or pam_howdy.so) as sufficient to any configuration file in /etc/pam.d/ will only prompt for face authentication. This prevents the use of a password if you cannot Ctrl+c face authentication (due to the lack of a shell). In order to use either a password or a face in a graphical interface, add the following line to the top of any files required:\n\n```\nauth sufficient pam_unix.so try_first_pass likeauth nullok\n```\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Determine the correct /dev/videoX file connected to the IR sensor. This can be done through various programs such as cheese, fswebcamAUR or v4l-utils.\n\nAn example of doing this with a tool included in the v4l-utils package:\n\n```\n$ v4l2-ctl --list-devices\nIntegrated_Webcam_HD: Integrate (usb-0000:00:14.0-11):\n        /dev/video0\n        /dev/video1\n\nEyeChip: Tobii Video (usb-0000:00:14.0-3.4.3):\n        /dev/video4\n        /dev/video5\n\nHD Webcam C525 (usb-0000:00:14.0-3.4.4):\n        /dev/video2\n        /dev/video3\n```\n\nAs seen in the example above, the command may show more than one webcam device, and for each device it may show multiple /dev/videoX paths. Generally picking the first of the two paths will work fine.\n\nIf you have more than one webcam and/or IR sensor using a /dev/videoX may be somewhat unstable overtime, as it may be prone to change paths if certain devices are unplugged and replugged back in. In this can consider using a more consistent path name supplied by Video4Linux in the /dev/v4l/by-id/ path.\n\n```\n$ ls -l /dev/v4l/by-id\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 15:01 usb-046d_HD_Webcam_C525_BE4703F0-video-index0 -> ../../video2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 15:01 usb-046d_HD_Webcam_C525_BE4703F0-video-index1 -> ../../video3\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 14:47 usb-CNFGH19N306021000582_Integrated_Webcam_HD-video-index0 -> ../../video0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 14:47 usb-CNFGH19N306021000582_Integrated_Webcam_HD-video-index1 -> ../../video1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 14:47 usb-Tobii_Technology_AB_EyeChip_IS404-100109244721-video-index0 -> ../../video4\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Dec  3 14:47 usb-Tobii_Technology_AB_EyeChip_IS404-100109244721-video-index1 -> ../../video5\n```\n\nYou can validate that these v4l paths do not change by unplugging and replugging your devices and then re-listing the directory.\n\nOnce the correct filename is found, edit /lib/security/howdy/config.ini using either your preferred editor or with howdy config (run as the root user). Change device_path = null to device_path = path_to_device:\n\n```\n/lib/security/howdy/config.ini\n```\n\n```\n# The path of the device to capture frames from\n# Should be set automatically by an installer if your distro has one\ndevice_path = path_to_device\n```\n\nTo customize which editor howdy config uses, set the EDITOR variable:\n\n```\n# EDITOR=editor howdy config\n```\n\n"

An attacker who has access could trivially find a snapshot corresponding to a successful login of the target user, print it, and use the printed photo to impersonate the target user, who presumably has more rights. Well, the attacker could also use any other photo of the target user, but Howdy simplifies the process too much.\n\nTo avoid this attack and also surprises about the disk space, disable taking snapshots in /lib/security/howdy/config.ini:\n\n```\n[snapshots]\ncapture_failed = false\ncapture_successful = false\n```\n\n"
