To supress the startup message, you can specify which backend to use when running Cairo-Dock by specifying it as an option.\n\nRun the dock with OpenGL backend:\n\n```\n$ cairo-dock -o &\n```\n\nRun the dock with Cairo backend:\n\n```\n$ cairo-dock -c &\n```\n\n"

Cairo-Dock uses the transparency feature of the composite manager to display the dock, and without it the dock will be displayed with a black background. If you are using a desktop environment, simply enable the composite manager or desktop effects in the settings.\n\nAn alternative solution that does not require a composite manager is to enable fake transparency in Cairo-Dock. To do this, right-click the dock and go to Cairo-Dock > Configure > Advanced Mode > System > Composition. Then enable both Emulate composition with fake transparency and Make the config panel transparent.\n\n"
