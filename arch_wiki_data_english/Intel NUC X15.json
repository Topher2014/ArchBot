The latter is not required but provides more functionality. If the AUR does not recognize the device, try building it yourself from Github.\n\nThe most comprehensive driver for this device is qc71-laptop-dkms-gitAUR, which can read and control fan speed, control the lightbar, enable Fn lock function keys, enable Meta key lock, and control charging limit. It has no user interface, but is quite functional.\n\nTo have touchpad toggle and Airplane mode toggle working, you can also try uniwill_wmi module in tuxedo-drivers-dkmsAUR. It has fewer features but has a user interface.\n\nIt is worth noting that these two AUR conflict with each other.\n\nAdditional steps may be required to get the screen to use a high refresh rate, see Intel graphics#Add support for 165Hz monitor and Kernel mode setting#Forcing modes and EDID.\n\n"
