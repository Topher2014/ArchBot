      "content": "The thinkpad-yoga-scripts-gitAUR package does not work well, because the TouchPad and TrackPoint manufacturer was changed. Using https://github.com/ffejery/thinkpad-l380-yoga-scripts instead works. See makepkg on how to build it. There is also an AUR: thinkpad-l380-yoga-scripts-gitAUR. Remember to edit the /opt/thinkpad-l380-yoga-scripts/rotate/thinkpad-rotate.py as hinted in the readme, because you will probably want the Touchscreen and Pen to rotate together with the screen.\n\n"
