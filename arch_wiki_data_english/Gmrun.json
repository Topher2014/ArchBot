      "content": "- GUI applications can just be typed in and run by pressing Enter, terminal applications can be run by using Ctrl+Enter. Pressing Ctrl+Enter with an empty input box will open up a terminal window.\n- Gmrun features tab completion: pressing tab will bring up a scrollable list of possible matches.\n- Web addresses entered into Gmrun will launch a web browser automatically.\n- The same goes for email addresses, using the mailto: prefix e.g. mailto:foo@bar.com, will launch your email client.\n- More shortcuts can be added to ~/.gmrunrc (See #Configuration below) or you can modify the system-wide file at /etc/gmrunc.\n- You can enter search mode by entering ! as the first letter, the title should change from Run program to Search, letters you input will then automatically come up with suggestions from your command history.\n- Ctrl+r will allow you to search backwards through that history.\n- Ctrl+s will search forward through the history.\n- Ctrl+g will cancel the search.\n- If an extension has been defined in the configuration file, files can be launched by the correct program just by typing the file name.\n- Press Esc to close Gmrun, without running anything.\n\n"
