Usually running windows own startup repair utility however fixes this issue in most cases. Another alternative is to follow this guide.\n\nThe reinstall can be done through the Dell recovery in the UEFI if needed.\n\nOnce you used the startup repair utility or have reinstalled, Windows should boot normally in AHCI mode and without error. Then one can proceed with typical dual boot setup.\n\n"

Without S0ix activated the laptop looses around 2% battery per hour.\n\nBoth NVIDIA's proprietary driver and nouveau reliably disable the NVIDIA card.\n\n"
