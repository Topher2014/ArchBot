A common example of this is rdesktop, which connects to a Microsoft Windows computer and uses the cursors obtained from the remote machine, which can often be difficult to see due to protocol limitations yielding poor conversion quality.\n\nThis can be resolved by replacing these cursors with ones from the same (or another) cursor theme. In order to do this, the hash of the image must be obtained. This is done by setting the XCURSOR_DISCOVER environment variable prior to launching the application that sets these cursors:\n\n```\n$ XCURSOR_DISCOVER=1 rdesktop ...\n```\n\nThe first time (and only the first time) the cursor is set, some details will be displayed, like this:\n\n```\nCursor image name: 24020000002800000528000084810000\n...\nCursor image name: 7bf1cc07d310bf080118007e08fc30ff\n...\nCursor hash 24020000002800000528000084810000 returns 0x0\n```\n\nWhen Xcursor looks for missing cursors, the search path includes ~/.icons/default/cursors so this is where an image can be placed for Xcursor to find. First, create this directory if it does not already exist:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p ~/.icons/default/cursors\n```\n\nThen link the hash to the target image. Here we are using the left_ptr image from the Vanilla-DMZ cursor theme:\n\n```\n$ ln -s /usr/share/icons/Vanilla-DMZ/cursors/left_ptr ~/.icons/default/cursors/24020000002800000528000084810000\n```\n\nThe change will be visible as soon as the application is restarted.
