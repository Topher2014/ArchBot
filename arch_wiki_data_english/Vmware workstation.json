This will prevent VMware from creating a .vmem file. Use mainmem.backing = \"swap\" on Linux hosts instead.\n- MemTrimRate: This setting prevents that memory which was released by the guest is released on the host also.\n- prefvmx.useRecommendedLockedMemSize: Unfortunately there does not seem to exist a proper explanation for this setting; it seems to prevent the host system from swapping parts of the guest memory.\n- MemAllowAutoScaleDown: Prevents VMware from adjusting the memory size of the virtual machine if it cannot allocate enough memory.\n- sched.mem.pshare.enable: If several virtual machines are running simultaneously, VMware will try to locate identical pages and share these between the virtual machines. This can be very I/O intensive.\n\nThe following settings can also be set in the configuration dialog of VMware Workstation(Edit -> Preferences... -> Memory/Priority).\n\n```\nprefvmx.minVmMemPct = \"100\"\nmainMem.partialLazySave = \"FALSE\"\nmainMem.partialLazyRestore = \"FALSE\"\n```\n\n- prefvmx.minVmMemPct: Sets amount of RAM in percent which should be reserved by the virtual machine on the host system. If this is set to a lower value it is possible to assign the virtual machine more memory than is available in the host system. Be careful though, as in this case it will most likely lead to excessive hard drive usage. If enough RAM is on the host system, this value should be left at 100.\n- mainMem.partialLazySave and mainMem.partialLazyRestore: These two parameters will prevent the virtual machine from creating partial snapshots for suspends. When these parameters are used, virtual machine suspension will take slightly longer, but there should be less hard disk activity from VMware trying to store this information.\n\n"
