To toggle it, you need to call some ACPI methods.\n\nFirst install acpi_call (or acpi_call-lts for LTS kernel, acpi_call-dkms for other kernels) and load the kernel module:\n\n```\n# modprobe acpi_call\n```\n\nSet it to Intelligent Cooling mode:\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.VPC0.DYTC 0x000FB001' > /proc/acpi/call\n```\n\nSet it to Extreme Performance mode:\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.VPC0.DYTC 0x0012B001' > /proc/acpi/call\n```\n\nSet it to Battery Saving mode:\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.VPC0.DYTC 0x0013B001' > /proc/acpi/call\n```\n\nTo verify your setting:\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.SPMO' > /proc/acpi/call\n# cat /proc/acpi/call; printf '\\n'\n```\n\nAs a result you get the value for the bit SPMO (either 0x0, 0x1 or 0x2).\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0.FCMO' > /proc/acpi/call\n# cat /proc/acpi/call; printf '\\n'\n```\n\nAs a result you get the value for the bit FCMO (either 0x0, 0x1 or 0x2). To interpret the results the following table can be used:\n\nTable content:\nSPMO | FCMO | Mode\n0x0 | 0x0 | Intelligent Cooling\n0x1 | 0x1 | Extreme Performance\n0x2 | 0x2 | Battery Saving\n\n"

      "level": 4,
      "content": "It is worth noting that the Lenovo Vantage software for Windows when turning on Battery Conservation mode also turns off #Rapid Charge (if it was on). The same is also valid for the #Rapid Charge: turning it on will bring the battery conservation mode down. The aforementioned acpi call #Battery Conservation will not do this for you, but #Rapid Charge will. So it is possible to get the state where both battery conservation and rapid charge modes are active if you activate #Battery Conservation after #Rapid Charge. You generally do not want this, as Rapid Charging puts more strain on the battery than regular charging, defeating the purpose of Battery Conservation Mode.\n\n"
