If at all you have tinkered with this option, reverting back to \"AHCI\" is a must for installing Arch.\n\n- If dual booting with an existing Windows installation, Windows may not boot after the change but this can be fixed without a reinstallation before changing the mode\n- Change Fastboot to \"Thorough\" as it prevents intermittent boot failures\n- Disable secure boot to allow Linux to boot\n\nInstallation of Arch Linux can proceed normally. Refer to the installation guide for more information. iwctl detects the NIC without any workaround; Wi-Fi and LAN work out of the box.\n\n"

Nonetheless, the power drain will be prodigious and disabling the Nvidia card altogether is also not an option, in which case there will be no video out through HDMI.\n\nThere is no way to get output from the Nvidia GPU through the type-C port and from the Intel GPU through the HDMI port even with Optimus configured perfectly.\n\n"
