If that fails, open the website's source code by pressing Ctrl+u and then Ctrl+f to search for <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" or <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\". The Firefox addon Awesome RSS adds a clickable icon to the address bar if a web feed is available.\n\nIf a website does not provide a feed, try RSS-Bridge.\n\nThe following sections describe how to obtain feeds for certain websites.\n\n"
