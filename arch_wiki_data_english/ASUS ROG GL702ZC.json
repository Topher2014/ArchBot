There is no suggested fix other than RMA; you can check if you are affected by running ryzen kill script. My personal experience is that I have two cores that cause these errors; and I had not have it happen much after configuring fans using nbfc.\n\nTo further investigate, check out Machine-check exception\n\n"

(See my BBS thread here) Currently, Wi-Fi works with the stable kernel; but is noticeably slower than the previous kernel module.\n\n"
