Log into Cisco Networking Academy (Skills For All / NetAcad) using your Cisco Account. Register an account if you do not have it.\n1. Once in the Networking Academy portal, download the Packet Tracer from https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads. The downloaded filename should be something like Packet_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb.\n1. Alternatively, if downloading from the legacy NetAcad portal at https://legacy.netacad.com/portal/resources/packet-tracer, the file will be named something like CiscoPacket_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb. You must rename this file to Packet_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb (exact filename will be printed out by the build script if not found) so it is recognized by the build script.\n1. Place the .deb file inside the folder where packettracerAUR's build files are locatedâ€”that is the same folder where the PKGBUILD file is found.\n\n"
