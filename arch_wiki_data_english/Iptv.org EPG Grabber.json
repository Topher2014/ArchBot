      "content": "First step is to create a working directory for iptvorg-epg EPG grabber. The working directory will be saved to the home directory of the active user or to a chosen path. All configuration and output files are stored in the working directory.\n\nTo create a working directory type:\n\n```\n# iptvorg-epg -d /path/to/working_directory\n```\n\nAt this point all necessary files are created and it's now possible to grab EPG data from a chosen site or custom channels xml configuration file.\n\nTo generate EPG guide file (default:guide.xml), type:\n\n```\n# iptvorg-epg -d /path/to/working_directory -s my.site.example\n```\n\nIn addition to the command above, it can be combined with --gzip, --days days and -o, --output file.\n\nFor a full listing of the active sites (including status), type:\n\n```\n# iptvorg-epg -ps\n```\n\nFor a full usage information, type:\n\n```\n# iptvorg-epg --help\n```\n\n"
