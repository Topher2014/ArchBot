However, Michael Buesch has created a tool called razercfg to configure Razer mice under Linux. There also exist scripts to enable macro keys of Razer keyboards.\n\nAnother driver, OpenRazer can be used to enable Razer support along with additional frontends for GUI configuration, with many more supported devices listed.\n\n"
