      "content": "It is recommended that you peruse all the available options and features in the BIOS as there are many of them and in some cases you will get unexpected behaviours, e.g. swapping the Fn and Ctrl keys, enabling topmost keyboard row F1 to F12 functionality as the default, etc. To access the BIOS, press Enter on boot-up. Enable Diagnostics mode bootup instead of Quick mode to make it easier to enter the BIOS.\n\n"

      "content": "In laptops with Secure Boot enabled, if you install a kernel module provided by a 3rd party or compiled by yourself, modprobe will not load it and will throw an error similar to this:\n\n```\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vboxdrv': Required key not available\n```\n\nSecure Boot will prevent this module from running until you provide a valid signature for it. Therefore, you can either try to sign it yourself or disable Secure Boot altogether. Unfortunately, the current Secure Boot firmware (v2.11 2016/09/26) installed in the ThinkPad T460 series BIOS is unable to complete the signing process, thus it is recommended to disable it in the BIOS configuration until this issue is resolved.\n\nSee also: [1]\n\n"

      "content": "The T460p's Validity fingerprint reader is unsupported by the fprint project's libfprint library. Thus, installing the libfprint-vfs009x-gitAUR package instead is necessary for the fingerprint reader to function. Discussion surrounding an official driver can be found at https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/_/Validity-Fingerprint-Reader-Linux/td-p/3352145.\n\nSee https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint#readme regarding device initialization. To initialize the fingerprint reader without using a Windows installation, install validity-sensors-tools-gitAUR and run the following command:\n\n```\n# validity-sensors-tools -t initializer\n```\n\nSee also https://linux-hardware.org/?id=usb:138a-0090.\n\n"
