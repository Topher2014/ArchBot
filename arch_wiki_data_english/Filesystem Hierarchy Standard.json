Because of that, you may rarely experience a kernel regression or driver bug, especially if using Wi-Fi. Do note that the vast majority of those bugs are not Arch Linux-specific as Arch Linux only applies the most basic of patches. This needs to be taken upstream.

      "title": "Why is Arch using all my RAM?",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Essentially, unused RAM is wasted RAM.\n\nMany new users notice how the Linux kernel handles memory differently than they are used to. Since accessing data from RAM is much faster than from a storage drive, the kernel caches recently accessed data in memory. The cached data is only cleared when the system begins to run out of available memory and new data needs to be loaded.\n\nWe could distinguish the difference from free command:\n\n```\n$ free -h\n```\n\n```\ntotal        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:          2.8Gi       1.1Gi       283Mi       224Mi       1.4Gi       1.2Gi\nSwap:         3.0Gi       881Mi       2.1Gi\n```\n\nIt is important to note the difference between \"free\" and \"available\" memory. In the above example, a laptop with 2.8 GiB of total RAM appears to be using most of it, with only 283 MiB as free memory. However, 1.4 GiB of it is \"buff/cache\". There is still 1.2 GiB available for starting new applications, without swapping. See free(1) for details. The result of all this? Performance!\n\nSee this wonderful article if your curiosity has been piqued. There is also a website dedicated to clearing this confusion: https://www.linuxatemyram.com/.\n\n"

By dropping support for outdated software, package maintainers are able to spend more time ensuring that the newest versions work as expected. As soon as a new version of a shared library becomes available from upstream, it is added to the repositories and affected packages are rebuilt to use the new version.\n\n"

Additionally, some packages spend some time in the testing repository, so this can prolong the time before a package is updated.

Beginners who immediately try to hack on system library files are in the greatest risk of making an unwanted change that they cannot diagnose/fix, which a package manager helps to guard against.\n- A slight alternative of dumping the old library file into the filesystem, untracked, would be forgotten about, and not have potential security bugs noticed/patched.\n\nInstead, e.g. use/write a compat (compatibility) package, which provides the required library version.\n\n"

If your computer has more than 4 GiB of RAM, only a 64-bit OS will be able to fully utilize it.\n\nProgrammers also increasingly tend to care less about 32-bit (\"legacy\") as \"new\" x86 CPUs typically support the 64-bit extensions.\n\nThere are many more reasons we could list here to tell you to avoid 32-bit, but between the kernel, userspace and individual programs it is simply not viable to list every last thing that 64-bit does much better these days.\n\n"
