If this does not work or only change your cursor size, try to start the application with\n\n```\n$ GDK_SCALE=2 pdfstudio\n```\n\nIf this helps, you could create a script like this:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nGDK_SCALE=2 pdfstudio\n```\n\nand put it in your PATH as pdfstudio-scaled to quickly start pdfstudio as pdfstudio-scaled.\n\n"
