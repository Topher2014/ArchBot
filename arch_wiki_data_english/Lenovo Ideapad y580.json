      "content": "Battery Conservation Mode is a feature that limits battery charging to 55-60% of its capacity to improve battery life, being most useful when the laptop tends to run on external power much of the time. This works on many Lenovo laptops like IdeaPad and Thinkbook series. To check if your laptop is supported, try to set the battery conservation mode in the Vantage app on Windows. If it works on Windows, it can be enabled or disabled on Linux in the following manner:\n\n- First make sure the ideapad_laptop kernel module is loaded, with the lsmod command.\n- If it is, run the following command as root to enable Battery Conservation Mode:# echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode\n- A 0 will in turn disable the feature.\n\n```\n# echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/ideapad_acpi/VPC2004:00/conservation_mode\n```\n\nNote: **VPC2004:00** \n\n- Both the presence and implementation of this feature vary by model. Particularly, the name of the folder VPC2004:00 could differ.\n- If the above does not work on your laptop, you can try a different method described here, which may require some (further) trial and error.\n\nIf you use GNOME you can install the Ideapad extension to get an easy toggle (don't forget to configure sudo for it as well).\n\nIf you instead use KDE, you can similarly install the PlasmaVantage applet to get a toggle (you can also enable Password-less operation).\n\n"

A workaround is available if you're willing to sacrifice suspend-to-ram for suspend-to-idle. The BIOS has two \"Sleep State\" options, called \"Windows\" (suspend-to-idle) and \"Linux\" (suspend-to-ram), which you can find in at Config -> Power -> Sleep State. If you change the setting to \"Windows\", this will change the state from suspend-to-ram to suspend-to-idle. You can see this if you run cat /sys/power/mem_sleep before and after the change.\n\nThe trackpoint and physical buttons will stop working after resuming from hibernate. Use modprobe -r psmouse followed by modprobe psmouse to get the functionailty back\n\nFingerprint reader is unsupported. Neither fprintd nor libfprintd-tod will work.\n\nIf the Fn keys do not work, to update the BIOS, download the \"Bootable CD\" of the BIOS Update, and use geteltoritoAUR to extract the .img from the .iso with geteltorito.pl -o bios.img downloaded.iso, then use etcher / mintstickAUR / dd to make a bootable USB.

The built-in miniDisplayPort will sometimes spew I²C issues into the kernel log. Hardware video acceleration is highly recommended as it performs significantly better than CPU decoding of large media files. The BIOS should not be upgraded past version 1.14, as newer BIOSes cause memory corruption when used with Bumblebee. See Bumblebee GitHub\n- Connectivity: Bluetooth is extremely fragile. The controller works fine most of the time, but can cause the system to wedge totally on sleep/wake cycles, especially if a connection was active at sleep.

Unfortunately this also disabled my Wi-Fi (it was seen by iwctl but never presented a station no matter what i did). I see others online also have this problem(various posts on stackexchange etc). I finally managed to fix it by also passing pci=realloc so the full line is:\n\n```\npci=nocrs pci=realloc\n```\n\nfor getting both Wi-Fi and touchpad working.\n\nNote: I am using refind as boot manager(holy cow so much more straight-forward and less confusing than grub2) and i seem to recall being unable to boot with pci=realloc using grub2. This could just be me dreaming though so it probably bears testing first.\n\nEverything else works, except the brightness keys -- which sometimes work, and sometimes do not. I have not figured out in which instance they work or not yet. I managed a fix which was to bind ctrl+f11 and ctrl+f12 in KDE to be able to set the brightness(up/down) all the time.\n\n"

The optical drive is of 9 mm height, but a 9,5 mm caddy (ultra slim) fits in the slot. A caddy with a SATA interface is needed. It is difficult to separate the front bezel from the original optical drive (and opening its case does not help, but brings a danger of making a mess in the opening mechanism; the only option is just to pull the bezel using a bit of force, but you risk breaking the latches).\n\nWhile the HDD installed instead of the optical drive operates flawlessly in Windows, it was not going to work out of the box in Linux, at least in one case. The kernel tries to establish a connection with the disk, but fails to do it (SATA link down entry in /var/log/messages). The solution is to force a 1.5 Gbps transfer speed (instead of 6 Gbps) by adding a libata.force= kernel parameter. See [6] for details.\n\n"
