It now has a Qt GUI that can visualize your audio output through either JACK or PulseAudio, in addition to a libvisualAUR component. This article currently focuses on the PulseAudio standalone GUI.\n\n"

Uncheck the checkbox at the bottom which says \"Try first available playback monitor,\" then select the correct device. Most likely it is one which ends in \".monitor\" (if you want the visualizer to visualize what's being output/played).\n\nSome information on usage and configuration can be found in the ProjectM FAQ\n\nOtherwise a good place to ask question are the projectM help forums on Sourceforge.\n\n"
