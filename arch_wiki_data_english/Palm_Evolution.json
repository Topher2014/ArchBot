In this case, press the transfer button on the cradle or \"Hotsync\" from the Palm Menus, type lsusb again, and you should get a display which resembles this.\n\n```\n$ lsusb\n```\n\n```\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  \nBus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  \nBus 003 Device 003: ID 055f:0006 Mustek Systems, Inc.

There are no special conduits in the standard Jpilot, such as Documents-To-Go, so either find those on the Internet (if they exist) or make them yourself.\n\nNext, do the same thing, but click the button below, for backup.

      "content": "Note: **This article or section is out of date.** This article or section is out of date.\n\nThis article or section is out of date.\n\nPalm devices come with built-in networking capabilities, as well as Bluetooth. If you also own a laptop, or have a USB Bluetooth adaptor, syncing over bluetooth, while being noticeably slower, is probably more convenient than keeping your sync cable handy.\n\nFirst, of course, you have to have bluetooth set up. Bluetooth provides the arch-specific guide to that, its currently quite short, but I had no problems following it. Of course, there is also the forums to ask for help.\n\nNext, there is the actual setup for syncing. Basically, this involves setting up a small LAN over Bluetooth connection. I did this following the guide in [2], the author of which followed the guide in [3]. Anyway, on to the real information.\n\nFirst we would need to pair the Palm and your PC. If you are using Bluez, then use blueman-manager to search for your Palm (make sure bluetooth is turned on and not hidden), then pair them (the button is labeled 'bond', for some reason or other). You would need to type in a verification pass-key. Alternatively, from the palm, search for your PC's bluetooth and set it as a trusted device.\n\nNext, on your Palm, go to Preferences->Connection and create a new connection, name it \"Laptop Bluetooth\" or whatever you like, set it to connect to a PC via Bluetooth, and select your PC from the list below. Next, you have to actually setup the network, going through Prefences->Network, create a new network, naming it again anything you want (I use \"Linux\"), select the connection you just created, and leave the user name and password blank (you could put something here, you would need to change the following steps accordingly though).\n\nTo set up your PC, first create the file /etc/ppp/peers/dun, with these contents:-\n\n```\n115200\n10.0.1.8:10.0.1.40\nlocal\nms-dns <enter your dns server address here>\nnoauth\ndebug\n```\n\nAs root, edit the file /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, adding this line:-\n\n```\nmylogin * mypassword *\n```\n\nIn a terminal, run dund as root (prefix with sudo if you are not logged in as root). You would need to make sure the bluetooth daemon is already started at this point.\n\n```\ndund --nodetach --listen --persist --msdun call dun\n```\n\nClick the 'Connect' button under Preferences->Networking for your Palm. In the terminal, some text should start scrolling, indicating a new connection, channels being used, and the sending and receiving of various packets. At this point, your connectivity is working fine.\n\nFor the Hotsync specific setup, navigate to 'Hotsync' on your palm, select 'Modem' instead of local. Go to the menu, and change the following preferences:-\n\n```\nModem Sync Preferences -> set Network instead of Direct to modem\nLANSync Preferences -> set LANSync instead of Local HotSync\nPrimary PC Setup -> Set the Primary PC Name and Address to 10.0.1.8, according to the settings previously in /etc/ppp/peers/dun\nConnection Setup -> select the connection you previously created (Laptop Bluetooth, for example)\n```\n\nUnder the Hotsync button, if the name you previously assigned to your network does not show (\"Linux\" in this example), select that area and it should automatically show \"Linux\". You are now ready to HotSync. Make sure dund is running, run your preferred sync-ing program using the interface net:any (I use JPilot, under File->Preferences->Settings->Serial Port I select 'other' and specify 'net:any'), and then click on the HotSync icon on your Palm. Enjoy wireless sync-ing.\n\n"

      "content": "In addition to USB and Bluetooth, the Palm T|X model includes Ethernet connectivity. To sync the device using a direct Ethernet connection with jpilotAUR, simply set the serial device to net:any in the Preferences dialog and then hotsync. On the Palm, you will need to select the name/ip address of the machine where jpilotAUR is running and then start the hotsync. Enjoy high speed wireless hotsync-ing.\n\n"

See Help:Style for reference.\n\nThe visor module does not currently work with the Palm Centro. It is not needed, as newer software accesses the Centro through libusb. To make the Palm work under Arch, blacklist the visor module. You may have to reboot for this change to take effect.\n\nWhen udev creates a device node for the Centro, it by default assigns it owner and group to root. You need to create a non-root group for udev to use for this device and make sure you are a member:\n\n```\n# groupadd palm\n# usermod -a -G palm username\n```\n\nYou will need to logout and re-login for the new group assignment to take effect. After you do, you should see palm in the list of groups when you run the groups command.\n\nYou now need to tell udev how to assign the Centro to the group palm when it is attached. Create the following file:\n\n```\n/etc/udev/rules.d/55-palm-centro.rules\n```\n\n```\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ENV{DEVTYPE}==\"usb_device\", \\\nATTR{idVendor}==\"0830\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0061\", \\\nNAME=\"bus/usb/$env{BUSNUM}/$env{DEVNUM}\", MODE=\"0664\", GROUP=\"palm\"\n```\n\nNow plug in the device. Verify that a device has been added which has group palm:\n\n```\n$ find /dev -group palm\n```\n\nThe device name does not really matter, as libusb will find it when needed.\n\nTo sync the device, if using jpilotAUR, simply specify usb: as the serial port in preferences.\n\n"
