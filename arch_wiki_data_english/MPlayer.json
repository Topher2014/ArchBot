To start at a specific chapter use the '-chapter' flag. For example, adding '-chapter 5' to the command starts the dvd playing at chapter five of the title.\n\nMplayer checks /dev/dvd by default. Tell it to use /dev/sr0 with the dvd-device option at the command line, or the dvd-device variable in ~/.mplayer/config.\n\nTo play a DVD image file:\n\n```\n$ mplayer -dvd-device movie.iso dvd://N\n```\n\nTo enable the DVD menu use:\n\n```\n$ mplayer dvdnav://\n```\n\nTo enable mouse support in DVD menus use:\n\n```\n$ mplayer -mouse-movements dvdnav://\n```\n\nTo find the audio language, start MPlayer with the -v switch to output audio IDs. An audio track is selected with -aid audio_id. Set a default audio language by editing ~/.mplayer/config and adding the line alang=en for English.\n\nWith MPlayer, the DVD could be set to a low volume. To increase the maximum volume to 400%, use softvol=yes and softvol-max=400. The startup volume defaults to 100% of software volume and the global mixer levels will remain untouched. Using the 9 and 0 keys, volume can be adjusted between 0 and 400 percent.\n\n```\nalang=en\nsoftvol=yes\nsoftvol-max=400\n```\n\n"

This is caused by the positioning information being interpreted as something to be displayed. Mplayer will also complain about subtitles being either too long or having too many lines.\n\nEnabling ass also enables any embedded fonts. As per the note in the mplayer's man adding embeddedfonts=true is unneeded if fontconfig is version 2.4.2 or newer. Fontconfig will also be used to select which font to use when there are no embedded fonts. This may result in a different font being used than the OSD subtitle renderer.\n\n"
