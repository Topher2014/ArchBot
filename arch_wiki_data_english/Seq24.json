To be able to listen to your music as you create it, you will need a MIDI device installed on your computer. Follow the instructions on the timidity wiki page to easily setup a software MIDI device. Then, when using seq24, (you will learn more about this in external documentation) select one of the \"TiMidity ports\" in the track editor to connect to a MIDI device. For example, on my computer, one of the devices is \"[1] 128:0 (TiMidity port 0)\".\n\n"

      "content": "To set a MIDI instrument, bring up a track editor window by right clicking a \"track box\" and selecting \"Edit...\". Select a MIDI device, or \"output bus\", and select a MIDI channel. There are 16 channels per MIDI device. Keep in mind that a channel can only play one instrument at a time. (So, you will not be able to play a piano sound on channel 5 and a flute sound on channel 5 at the same time) Also, channel 10 is always percussion. Next, select the \"Event\" button and select \"Program Change\". Add a program change event to the first tiny box underneath the keyboard roll by holding down the right mouse button and left clicking on it. Now, select the event box you just created with the left mouse button. You can now use the scroll wheel or right mouse button in the space above the instrument number to change the value of the MIDI instrument. The instrument probably will not be set until the next time you \"play\" through that section of the track. You can read more about the standard set of MIDI instruments here.\n\n"
