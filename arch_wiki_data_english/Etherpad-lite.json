With that, you can run and test Etherpad-Lite without any further configuration.\n\nIf you want to use MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite, you can adjust those settings in the settings.json file. Further, you can set a password for the administrator interface on http://localhost:9001/admin, change port and listening address, etc.\n\nAt least, do not forget to set a sessionkey, e.g. generate with pwgen and pwgen --symbols 10 1 and write it down to /etc/etherpad-lite/SESSIONKEY.txt.\n\nYour Etherpad installation can be extended with plugins listed at the administrator interface.\n\n"
