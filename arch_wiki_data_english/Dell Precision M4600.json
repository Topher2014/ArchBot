As far as I can tell it is correct and accurate, but I was unable to log the PowerButton events on my system.)\n\nIn this case, LNXPWRBN:00 (/dev/input/event3) is the \"real\", physical power button. You can verify this by inhibiting the handling of the power button\n\n```\n# systemd-inhibit --what=handle-power-key sleep 1h\n```\n\nand recording the events:\n\n```\n# stdbuf -o0 evemu-record /dev/input/event3 > event3\n```\n\nPressing the power button should log an event.\n\nThe other detected power button seems to be a virtual, firmware-handled button. This power button will be triggered when your device runs out of battery. It seems like this is a long button press and it will cause systemd to only wait a few seconds before killing a process, so your machine will most likely only take a few seconds to power off.\n\n"
