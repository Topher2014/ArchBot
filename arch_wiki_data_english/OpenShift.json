      "content": "Red Hat OpenShift Local can be used to install an OpenShift v4 cluster.\n\nThe installation is described in the Getting Started Guide[dead link 2025-01-22 â“˜] (please check for correct version). The installation asks for sudo rights (maybe not needed?) and will install an openshift cluster using kvm/libvirt. Since Arch Linux is not natively supported by the setup procedure, make sure you have the prerequisites installed: libvirt, qemu-base, dnsmasq and networkmanager. It will add the current user to the libvirt group. One also needs a secret from cloud.redhat.com (account is needed) that can be obtained in the Red Hat Cloud Console.\n\nThe basic steps for installing crc on your computer:\n\n```\n#untar downloaded archive\ntar -xJf crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz\n#create a bin link so that future versions only need relinking, no new path\nln -s crc-linux-<VERSION>-amd64 bin\n#add bin folder to PATH and restart your terminal so that PATH is updated (or source config file)\n...\n#create base install of crc takes some minutes (will ask for secret)\ncrc setup\n#start openshift cluster\ncrc start\n#get credentials of openshift instance\ncrc console --credentials\n#open console in webbrowser\ncrc console\n```\n\n"
