It seems to apply to both Xorg and Wayland. During the display server startup, the XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomb) reports:\n\n```\n> Warning:          Compat map for group 2 redefined\n>                   Using new definition\n> Warning:          Compat map for group 3 redefined\n>                   Using new definition\n> Warning:          Compat map for group 4 redefined\n>                   Using new definition\nErrors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server\n```\n\nOne solution is to comment out the following lines in the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/compat/basic. The double forward-slash is the comment symbol.\n\n```\n//    group 2 = AltGr;                                                                \n //    group 3 = AltGr;\n //    group 4 = AltGr;\n```\n\nThis solution of provided in the forum thread Xkeyboard/xkbcomp gives warnings.\n\n"
