Teamspeak also creates the first ServerQuery administration account (the superuser) and the first virtual server including a privilege key for the server administrator of this virtual server. The privilege key is only displayed once on standard output.\n\n- Start and enable teamspeak3-server.service.\n\n- To find the privilege key check the unit status.\n\n- Scan the output for the privilege key:\n\n```\nExample output:\n```\n\n```\n● teamspeak3-server.service - TeamSpeak3 Server\n   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/teamspeak3-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Sat 2015-09-05 23:34:42 BST; 49min ago\n Main PID: 20126 (teamspeak3-serv)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/teamspeak3-server.service\n           └─20126 /usr/bin/teamspeak3-server logpath=/var/log/teamspeak3-server/ dbsqlpath=/usr/share/teamspeak3-server/sql/\n\nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: serveradmin rights for your virtualserver. please\nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: also check the doc/privilegekey_guide.txt for details.\nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: token=lcUEBG5YVxnhzPcS5hAmOkW1Zb6KbTZbkntbPFca                                                     \nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: ------------------------------------------------------------------\nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: 2015-09-05 22:34:45.322567|INFO    |CIDRManager   |   | updated query_ip_whitelist ips: 127.0.0.1,\nSep 05 23:34:45 Your-Hostname teamspeak3-server[20126]: 2015-09-05 22:34:45.323806|INFO    |Query         |   | listening on 0.0.0.0:10011\nSep 05 23:34:53 Your-Hostname systemd[1]: Started TeamSpeak3 Server.\n```\n\n- The privilege key is what token is equal to.\n\n- Alternatively, you can navigate to the logs directory for teamspeak3-server and read the output log directly.
