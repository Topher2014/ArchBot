In Wayland, these keys might be difficult to map but can be doable manually using the in your desktop environment by specifying the XF86 keysym by hand from the table below. For example, in Gnome you can use dconf-editor to modify entries in /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/ and other settings locations.\n\nTable content:\nKey | Visible?1 | Marked?2 | Effect\nFn+Esc | No | Yes | Toggles Fn lock\nFn+F1 | Yes | Yes | XF86AudioMute\nFn+F2 | Yes | Yes | XF86AudioLowerVolume\nFn+F3 | Yes | Yes | XF86AudioRaiseVolume\nFn+F4 | Yes | Yes | XF86AudioMicMute\nFn+F5 | Yes | Yes | XF86MonBrightnessDown\nFn+F6 | Yes | Yes | XF86MonBrightnessUp\nFn+F7 | Yes | Yes | XF86Display\nFn+F8 | No | No | \nFn+F9 | No | No | \nFn+F10 | No | Yes | XF86Launch2\nFn+F11 | No | No | No\nFn+F12 | Yes | Yes | XF86Favorites\nFn+PrtSc | No | No | \nFn+Space | Yes | Yes | Toggle Keyboard Backlight\nFn+4 | Yes | No | XF86Sleep\nFn+Left | Yes | No | Home\nFn+Right | Yes | No | End\nFn+l | No | No | Switch to low power mode\nFn+m | No | No | Switch to balanced/medium power mode\nFn+h | No | No | Switch to performance/high power mode\nFn+u, Fn+s | No | No | Enable/Disable USB-C restricted mode3\n\n1.

[1]\n\nWWAN modules are detected with lspci(8). For example, RM520N-GL is shown running lspci -nn as:\n\n```\n08:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. Device [1eac:1007]\n```\n\nThe three WWAN modules are detected out-of-the-box. However, FCC must be unlocked before the modules can be used with a SIM or an eSIM.\n\nFor example, modemmanager can automatically unlock the module RM520N-GL by adding the following symlink:\n\n```\n# ln -s /usr/share/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.available.d/1eac /etc/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.d/1eac:1007\n```\n\nFor other modules, read Mobile_broadband_modem#FCC_locking and the ModemManager documentation.\n\n"

Updates to the UEFI firmware include updates to the Intel Management Engine, so they may fail altogether if IME is disabled on the UEFI settings. A workaround for this is to temporarily enable IME, upgrade the firmware with fwupd, and disable IME after that.\n\nSecure boot works out of the box with custom keys from multiple tools, including sbctl.\n\n"
