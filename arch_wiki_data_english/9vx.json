If you run the official Plan9 root file system, you will here also get a small tutorial about how to use rio and acme.\n- invoke \"9vx -r /path/to/plan9\" to start as your user (at first run, write /sys/lib/newuser at the rc prompt to set up your environment).\n\n"

You will most likely run into issues where directories can not be created since the virtual Plan9 system lacks write permissions.\n\n"
