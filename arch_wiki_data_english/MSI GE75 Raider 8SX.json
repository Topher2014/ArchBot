      "content": "Although the dedicated graphics seem to be working perfectly with PRIME, there are a few odd issues that might occur on the 8SE.\n\n- Performance issues of various kinds when the display refresh rate is misconfigured (correct refresh rate is 144hz)\n- Hard system (GPU Driver Crash?) freeze when running some games with VSync disabled (Tested in Subnautica and No Man's Sky) and in some games for unknown reasons (War Thunder); It also happens when recording long videos with ffmpeg using nvenc (5 min+). This issue can be solved by not using PRIME offloading (e.g. use the dGPU as your main graphics card for X, for instance through optimus-manager-gitAUR)\n- *RESOLVED* When using mpv with its vulkan renderer, you may experience major issues when resizing the window. Setting vulkan-queue-count=1 and swapchain-depth=1 fixes the issue. See git issue for mpv.\n- Prime-sync seems not to work when following common instructions to enable it/check if it is enabled, although functionally the card is fine when used with prime, when using the dgpu to run x (with nvidia-xurn or optimus manager) instead of the iGPU, there will be a very high amount of tearing.\n\nThe crashing and mpv issues could be regressions, most likely in the nvidia drivers, they were not present in early 2019.\n\nIt is uncertain if these issues are bound to the model or if they are faults in the specific device tested on. Overall, all issues are something that is easy to workaround (ensure refresh rate is correctly configured for the display in X, make sure to keep vsync on in video games, use the suggested settings for mpv and use prime normally when you want to use the GPU).\n\n"

To make these keys usable, you need to add this to your ~/.Xmodmap:\n\n```\nkeycode  93 = XF86TouchpadToggle NoSymbol XF86TouchpadToggle\nkeycode 120 = XF86Tools NoSymbol XF86Tools\nkeycode 126 = XF86Battery NoSymbol XF86Battery\n```\n\nUnderstandably, the Turbo and Eco mode buttons do not do anything on Linux since we do not have the Dragon Center software required for those buttons to do anything. You can however now use sxhkd, xbindkeys or your window manager to bind those keys to whatever custom function you want.\n\nThere is a remaining issue however where when Fn+F3 is pressed, Meta+Ctrl are also pressed, this issue is also present on Windows (probably a hardware flaw). This issue sometimes seems to interfere with the buttons functionality. For instance default keybinds for XF86TouchpadToggle will not work due to the forced modifiers. Even if you do change the keybind in your DE by going to the appropriate shortcut and hitting Fn+F3 to register it, it is not actually guaranteed to work (in KDE for instance you may get a popup that says the touchpad is on/off, but the touchpad is never actually toggled)\n\nIn the end to be able to toggle your touchpad you may need to bind it to a custom script.\n\n"
