      "content": "Make sure to adjust following variables to these minimal values in your php.ini:\n\n```\n/etc/php/php.ini\n```\n\n```\nextension=exif\nextension=gd\nextension=iconv\nextension=mysqli\nsession.save_path = \"/tmp\"\noutput_buffering = Off\n\nfile_uploads = On\npost_max_size = 20G\nupload_max_filesize = 20G\nmax_file_uploads = 20000\n```\n\nIn this configuration, we will configure the Nginx web server to serve Pydio on localhost in the root location without SSL enabled (even though it is recommended to use it with SSL). First, place a copy of the Pydio Nginx configuration\n\n```\n# cp /usr/share/doc/pydio/nginx.conf.sample /etc/webapps/pydio/nginx.conf\n```\n\nreplace the domain name\n\n```\n# sed -i 's/pydio.example.com/localhost/g' /etc/webapps/pydio/nginx.conf\n```\n\nand reference this configuration file in the main nginx.conf:\n\n```\n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n\n```\nhttp {\n    [...]\n    include /etc/webapps/pydio/nginx.conf;\n    [...]\n }\n```\n\nHere is an example on how you could setup a database for Pydio with MariaDB called pydio for the user pydio identified by the password password:\n\n```\nCREATE DATABASE pydio;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pydio.* TO pydio@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pydio';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n```\n\nDo not forget to (re)start your services (e.g. nginx.service and php-fpm.service)!\n\nVisit the installation wizard page at http://127.0.0.1/ and follow the instructions.\n\n"
