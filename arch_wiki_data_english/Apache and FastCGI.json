Make sure that the following is present and uncommented in your httpd.conf:\n\n```\nLoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so\n```\n\nThen you need to tell Apache when to use FastCGI.\n\nFor example you can ask Apache to treat all .fcgi files as fastcgi applications:\n\n```\n<IfModule fcgid_module>\n  AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi # you can put whatever extension you want\n</IfModule>\n```\n\nRemember that standard CGI restrictions apply, files must be in an ExecCGI enabled directory to execute.\n\n"
