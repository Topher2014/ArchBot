It is used in Intel Cedarview CPUs (Atom D2500, D2550, D2700, N2600 and N2800).\n\nThe Linux kernel has support since version 3.5, but since version 4.15 the relevant kernel driver, uvesafb, has not been included in the kernel so using the DKMS version of the driver is necessary. See uvesafb for more information.\n\n"
