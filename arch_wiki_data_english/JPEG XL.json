      "content": "libjxl comes with the official encoder/decoder programs: cjxl and djxl. JPEG XL is also supported by imagemagick and ffmpeg. To convert existing formats to jxl (JPEG files are compressed losslessly by default) use:\n\n```\n$ cjxl input.jpg lossless.jxl\n```\n\nTo display image metadata:\n\n```\n$ jxlinfo input.jxl\n```\n\nExiftool also supports jxl since 12.25, but might be limited by some metadata that needs to be decoded. --compress_boxes=0 flag can be passed to cjxl to keep metadata uncompressed, making it possible for Exiftool to parse it.\n\nFor file de-duplication purposes, it might be desirable to get the checksum of the actual encoded image:\n\n```\n$ exiftool -api ImageHashType=MD5 -ImageDataHash\n```\n\n"
