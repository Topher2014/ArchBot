      "level": 3,
      "content": "The soundtrack of the game is made of MIDI files. Therefore, you need a MIDI synthesizer to play them.\n\nThe game will automatically try to use FluidSynth with no additional arguments. Make sure a soundfont is also installed. Usually, installing soundfont-fluid should enable music playback.\n\nIf for some reason you need/want to use another synthesizer, OpenTTD provides the \"extmidi\" music driver, which allows you to configure a command to be ran to play music.\n\n- When using the extmidi driver, the in-game volume control sliders are disabled and cannot be used to change the volume.\n- If the command you want to run is not included in $PATH, you must specify the absolute path.\n\nEdit your openttd.cfg to configure extmidi :\n\n```\n~/.openttd/openttd.cfg\n```\n\n```\n[misc]\nmusicdriver = \"extmidi:cmd=<command>\"\n```\n\nHowever, extmidi does not allow additionnal arguments in the command. The solution is to use a wrapper script:\n\n```\n~/.openttd/playmidi\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#here, we want to use the FluidSynth synthesizer with the soundfont\n#provided in soundfont-fluid and PulseAudio\n\ntrap \"pkill fluidsynth\" EXIT\nfluidsynth -a pulseaudio -i /usr/share/soundfonts/FluidR3_GM2-2.sf2 $*\n```\n\nMark it as executable.\n\nThen you can specify the full path to the script as the command to be used with extmidi :\n\n```\n~/.openttd/openttd.cfg\n```\n\n```\n[misc]\nmusicdriver = \"extmidi:cmd=/home/<user>/.openttd/playmidi\"\n```\n\n"
