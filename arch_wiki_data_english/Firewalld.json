      "content": "Enable and start firewalld.service.\n\nYou can control the firewall rules with the firewall-cmd console utility.\n\nfirewall-offline-cmd utility can be used to configure when firewalld is not running. It features similar syntax to firewall-cmd.\n\nGUI is available as firewall-config which comes with firewalld package.\n\nWith the nftables backend, firewalld does not assume complete control over the hosts firewalling. Since nftables allows multiple \"namespaces\" via tables, firewalld will scope all of its rules, sets, and chains to the firewalld table. Firewalld does not do a complete flush of firewall rules, it will only flush rules in the firewalld table.\n\nnftables allows multiple chains to hook into netfilter at the same point. Packets that are accepted by a chain are still subject to the rules of other chains hooked into the hook type and in the drop case processing always stops immediately and no other hooks will process the packet. To ensure predictability of the execution order of chains, firewalld gives its rules slightly lower precedence than default nftables hook priority values. Consequently, firewall rules created outside of firewalld (e.g. by libvirt, Docker, Podman, systemd-nspawn, etc.) will be processed before firewalld rules and packets accepted by them will still be subject to firewalld rules.\n\n"
