Wait a few seconds for the daemon to calculate the Proof-Of-Work to propagate your registration. You’ll be redirected to the Edit Profile tab: complete it. Wait a few minutes until your registration is accepted into a new block. The “Save” button will be disabled in the meantime.\n\nThe next time you enter the page, press \"Login\" and choose your newly created user to login.\n\n"
