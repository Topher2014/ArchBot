      "content": "It is possible to start terminator with a random profile every time. To avoid unexpected behavior, you should start with a clean [profiles] section. You can copy the one from this file. It contains many well-known color schemes. Copy its contents to your config file, which is located in ~/.config/terminator/. Then, sed your list of profiles to a destination of your choice.\n\n```\n$ sed -n -e '/background_color/{x;1!s/.*\\[\\[\\(.*\\)\\]\\]/\\1/p;g;D;}' -e h $HOME/.config/terminator/config > $HOME/.config/terminator/profiles\n```\n\nWhen you add more profiles in the future and would like to have them included in the startup pool, you will have to reissue the command above. You can create an alias.\n\nYou must now modify Terminator's desktop file so that it selects a random profile from this list at startup.\n\n```\n$ cp /usr/share/applications/terminator.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n```\n\nFind the Exec line and comment it out with #. Add your own Exec line as follows.\n\n```\n~/.local/share/applications/terminator.desktop\n```\n\n```\n# Exec=terminator\nExec=sh -c \"terminator -p $( shuf -n 1 $HOME/.config/terminator/profiles )\"\n```\n\nSave the file and restart your desktop environment.\n\n"
