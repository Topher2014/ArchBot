Alternatively, you can choose to set up Secure Boot so that it works with Linux and you can take advantage of its potential security benefits.\n\nInstallation of Arch Linux can proceed normally. Refer to the Installation guide for more information.\n\n"

This seems to be a common problem with the Realtek ALC298 codec (so it is a low-level HDA issue, that occurs with or without `sof` installed). (see eg launchpad, superuser (Ubuntu), debian, and linuxmint forum ; and upstream thesofproject#4363).\n\nThe workaround is to apply solution (1) from comment 14 in Kernel bug 212041. This should work immediately and then needs to be applied on each (cold) boot with eg systemd.\n\n"
