They can be accessed by pressing F2 repeatedly when booting.\n\n- Change the SATA Mode from the default \"RAID\" to \"AHCI\". This will allow Linux to detect the NVMe SSD. If dual booting with an existing Windows installation, Windows will not boot after the change but this can be fixed without a re-installation.\n- Change Fastboot to \"Thorough\" in \"POST Behaviour\". This prevents intermittent boot failures.\n- Disable Secure Boot to allow Linux to boot. Alternatively, you can choose to set up Secure Boot so that it works with Linux and you can take advantage of its potential security benefits.\n\nInstallation of Arch Linux can proceed normally. Refer to the Installation guide for more information.\n\n"

The libsmbios package provides many tools for reading and modifying certain settings on the computer. The smbios-thermal-ctl command can be used with the --set-thermal-mode flag to change the fan between modes performance, cool-bottom, quiet and balanced. For example:\n\n```\n# smbios-thermal-ctl --set-thermal-mode quiet\n```\n\nthis changes the fan mode to quiet, which makes the fan curve less aggressive.\n\nThe thermometer on the discrete Nvidia GPU can be monitored with the nvidia-smi utility, which is part of nvidia-utils.\n\n"
