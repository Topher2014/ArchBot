See [1] and [2].\n- To hide Thunderbird's User Agent, set mailnews.headers.useMinimalUserAgent to false and create a new empty general.useragent.override string entry in the #Config editor.\n- JavaScript is disabled for message content but not for RSS news feeds. To disable set javascript.enabled to false in the #Config editor.\n\n- Setting javascript.enabled to false also turns off Javascript in OAuth dialogs.\n- Setting general.useragent.override to an empty string is known to break Duo MFA.

There is a bug report for this issue that includes workarounds with varying effects. To achieve ISO-8601-formatted dates in Thunderbird and a week beginning on Monday, use LC_TIME=lt_LT thunderbird.\n\nStarting in Thunderbird version 91, one can set a number of preferences to make Thunderbird compliant with ISO-8601.
