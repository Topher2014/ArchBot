      "content": "systemd has its own logging system called the journal; running a separate logging daemon is not required. To read the log, use journalctl(1).\n\nIn Arch Linux, the directory /var/log/journal/ is a part of the systemd package, and the journal (when Storage= is set to auto in /etc/systemd/journald.conf) will write to /var/log/journal/. If that directory is deleted, systemd will not recreate it automatically and instead will write its logs to /run/log/journal/ in a non-persistent way. However, the directory will be recreated if Storage=persistent is added to journald.conf and systemd-journald.service is restarted (or the system is rebooted).\n\nSystemd journal classifies messages by Priority level and Facility. Logging classification corresponds to classic Syslog protocol (RFC 5424).\n\n"

      "title": "Filtering output",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "journalctl allows for the filtering of output by specific fields. If there are many messages to display, or if the filtering of large time spans has to be done, the output of this command can be extensively delayed.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Show all messages matching PATTERN: # journalctl --grep=PATTERN\n- Show all messages from this boot: # journalctl -b However, often one is interested in messages not from the current, but from the previous boot (e.g. if an unrecoverable system crash happened). This is possible through optional offset parameter of the -b flag: journalctl -b -0 shows messages from the current boot, journalctl -b -1 from the previous boot, journalctl -b -2 from the second previous and so on – you can see the list of boots with their numbers by using journalctl --list-boots. See journalctl(1) for a full description; the semantics are more powerful than indicated here.\n- Include explanations of log messages from the message catalog where available: # journalctl -x Note that this feature should not be used when attaching logs to bug reports and support threads, as to limit extraneous output. You can list all known catalog entries by running journalctl --list-catalog.\n- Show all messages from date (and optional time): # journalctl --since=\"2012-10-30 18:17:16\"\n- Show all messages since 20 minutes ago: # journalctl --since \"20 min ago\"\n- Follow new messages: # journalctl -f\n- Show all messages by a specific executable: # journalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n- Show all messages by a specific identifier: # journalctl -t sudo\n- Show all messages by a specific process: # journalctl _PID=1\n- Show all messages by a specific unit: # journalctl -u man-db.service\n- Show all messages from user services by a specific unit: $ journalctl --user -u dbus\n- Show kernel ring buffer: # journalctl -k\n- Show only error, critical and alert priority messages: # journalctl -p err..alert You can use numeric log level too, like journalctl -p 3..1. If single number/log level is used, journalctl -p 3, then all higher priority log levels are also included (i.e. 0 to 3 in this case).\n- Show auth.log equivalent by filtering on syslog facility: # journalctl SYSLOG_FACILITY=10\n- If the journal directory (by default located under /var/log/journal) contains a large amount of log data then journalctl can take several minutes to filter output. It can be sped up significantly by using --file option to force journalctl to look only into most recent journal: # journalctl --file /var/log/journal/*/system.journal -f\n\n```\n# journalctl --grep=PATTERN\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -b\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -x\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl --since=\"2012-10-30 18:17:16\"\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl --since \"20 min ago\"\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -f\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl /usr/lib/systemd/systemd\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -t sudo\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl _PID=1\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -u man-db.service\n```\n\n```\n$ journalctl --user -u dbus\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -k\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl -p err..alert\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl SYSLOG_FACILITY=10\n```\n\n```\n# journalctl --file /var/log/journal/*/system.journal -f\n```\n\nSee journalctl(1), systemd.journal-fields(7), or Lennart Poettering's blog post for details.\n\n- By default, journalctl truncates lines longer than screen width, but in some cases, it may be better to enable wrapping instead of truncating. This can be controlled by the SYSTEMD_LESS environment variable, which contains options passed to less (the default pager) and defaults to FRSXMK (see less(1) and journalctl(1) for details).\n\n```\n$ SYSTEMD_LESS=FRXMK journalctl\n```\n\n- While the journal is stored in a binary format, the content of stored messages is not modified. This means it is viewable with strings, for example for recovery in an environment which does not have systemd installed, e.g.:$ strings /mnt/arch/var/log/journal/af4967d77fba44c6b093d0e9862f6ddd/system.journal | grep -i message\n\n```\n$ strings /mnt/arch/var/log/journal/af4967d77fba44c6b093d0e9862f6ddd/system.journal | grep -i message\n```\n\n"

      "content": "If the journal is persistent (non-volatile), its size limit is set to a default value of 10% of the size of the underlying file system but capped at 4 GiB. For example, with /var/log/journal/ located on a 20 GiB partition, journal data may take up to 2 GiB. On a 50 GiB partition, it would max at 4 GiB. To confirm current limits on your system review systemd-journald unit logs:\n\n```\n# journalctl -b -u systemd-journald\n```\n\nThe maximum size of the persistent journal can be controlled by uncommenting and changing the following:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf\n```\n\n```\nSystemMaxUse=50M\n```\n\nIt is also possible to use the drop-in snippets configuration override mechanism rather than editing the global configuration file. In this case, place the overrides under the [Journal] header:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/00-journal-size.conf\n```\n\n```\n[Journal]\nSystemMaxUse=50M\n```\n\nRestart the systemd-journald.service after changing this setting to apply the new limit.\n\nSee journald.conf(5) for more info.\n\n"

Rotation of journal files can be done by running journalctl --rotate. The --rotate argument can also be provided alongside one or more vacuum criteria arguments to perform rotation and then trim files in a single command.\n\nSee journalctl(1) for more info.\n\n"
