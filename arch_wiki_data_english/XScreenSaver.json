You can select a theme using xscreensaver-settings or by changing the dialogTheme option (dialogTheme: themename in ~/.xscreensaver or using X resources: xscreensaver-auth.dialogTheme: themename).\n\nYou can customize themes using X resources. The example below demonstrates changing some colors and fonts. If you are using a non-default theme, replace default with the name of your chosen theme in lower case, or use question mark (?) to affect all themes:\n\n```\n~/.Xresources\n```\n\n```\n! Font for regular texts.\n! Font names are case-insensitive.\n! You can use a comma-separated list of fonts to set a fallback font.\nxscreensaver-auth.default.Dialog.bodyFont: times new roman 12, dejavu serif 12\n\n! Window background color. You can use color names.\nxscreensaver-auth.default.Dialog.background: black\n\n! Main text color.

To configure the timings for blanking, standby, display poweroff and such, use xscreensaver-demo or edit the configuration file manually, e.g. ~/.xscreensaver:\n\n```\ntimeout:\t1:00:00\ncycle:\t\t0:05:00\nlock:\t\tFalse\nlockTimeout:\t0:00:00\npasswdTimeout:\t0:00:30\nfade:\t\tTrue\nunfade:\t\tFalse\nfadeSeconds:\t0:00:03\ndpmsEnabled:\tTrue\ndpmsStandby:\t2:00:00\ndpmsSuspend:\t2:00:00\ndpmsOff:\t4:00:00\n```\n\nDPMS and screen blanking can be disabled by starting xscreensaver-demo and, for the Mode setting, choosing Disable Screen Saver.\n\n"

To disable it, edit the plasma-ksmserver.service user unit:\n\n```\n~/.config/systemd/user/plasma-ksmserver.service.d/override.conf\n```\n\n```\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/bin/ksmserver --no-lockscreen\n```\n\nAlso open KDE System Settings and disable Power Management > Turn off screen.\n\nThen logout and login again, and XScreenSaver should work properly now. See xscreensaver(1) ยง INSTALLING XSCREENSAVER ON KDE for more information.\n\nTo immediately trigger xscreensaver, if it is running, and lock the screen, execute the following command:\n\n```\n$ xscreensaver-command -lock\n```\n\n"
