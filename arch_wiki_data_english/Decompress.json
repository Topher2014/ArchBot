      "content": "The traditional Unix archiving and compression tools are separated according to the Unix philosophy:\n\n- A file archiver combines several files into one archive file, e.g. tar.\n- A compression tool compresses and decompresses data, e.g. gzip.\n\nThese tools are often used in sequence by firstly creating an archive file and then compressing it.\n\nOf course there are also tools that do both, which tend to additionally offer encryption, error detection and recovery.\n\n"
