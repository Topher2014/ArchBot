This way, each time you fire up the terminal, the command gets executed. If you do not yet have a .bashrc file in your home directory, it is OK to create one with just this line in it. If you do not add > /dev/null then each time you fire a terminal, you will see a non-disruptive message saying: access control disabled, clients can connect from any host, which is your confirmation that you can now run your_software as root without issue.\n\n"
