You can see it after the Soundcards recognised by ALSA section Both are using snd_hda_nvidia and you normally can only apply the model to that and you want to apply to PCH. So if that comes after Nvidia you can only use\n\n```\nsnd_hda_intel: model=,1043:1982\n```\n\nAnd you are good to go. Or\n\n```\nsnd_hda_intel: model=1043:1982\n```\n\nif PCH is the first one.\n\n"

Also for some reason optimus does not always start with the latest kernel. At this point I would suggest using envycontrol if you would like to use nvidia only.\n\nFan-curves works with kernel version 5.17 and up or there is an option to use the linux-g14AUR kernel.\n\nSee https://asus-linux.org/\n\n"
