      "content": "The team behind Mooltipass was faced with the great complexity of password based authentication which require a strict policy including:\n\n- A unique password for every usage;\n- A hardly-guessable password;\n\nIn order to combine security of such policy and usability people came with software password managers like KeePass. Unfortunately, such solution implies that all credentials remains in computer memory, so it could eventually be stolen by a malicious software.\n\nMooltipass is an external device, on which credential are stored encrypted using AES-CTR and a key of 256 bits stored on an pin-locked smartcard. When plugged, the Mooltipass emulates an HID device and will act like a keyboard to send your credentials information to the targeted application. Even if an attacker is able to sniff at some point the communication between the device and the host it is likely that they will not be able to gather all credentials nor to inject their own data.\n\n"
