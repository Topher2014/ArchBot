      "content": "BMPanel2 features a simple launchbar that you may configure manually.\n\nIn order for this to work, the theme must have the launchbar enabled. Edit the theme file and make sure that it has something to this extent (the xx's represent icon size):\n\n```\nlaunchbar\n\ticon_size xx xx\n```\n\nNext, you must edit the configuration file for bmpanel2, usually located at ~/.config/bmpanel2/bmpanel2rc. For each entry, you must provide the command to execute along with an icon.\n\nAn example configuration is given below:\n\n```\ntheme xsocam_dark\n\nlaunchbar\n\texec urxvt\n\t\ticon /usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-term.png\n\texec firefox\n\t\ticon /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png\n\texec blender\n\t\ticon /usr/share/pixmaps/blender.png\n\texec urxvt -e htop\n\t\ticon /usr/share/pixmaps/htop.png\n\texec gvim\n\t\ticon /usr/share/pixmaps/gvim.png\n```\n\n"
