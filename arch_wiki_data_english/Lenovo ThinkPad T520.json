One of the other modes must be used to make the DisplayPort available.\n- A maximum of one external monitor can be used in Discrete Graphics mode since the NVIDIA (discrete) graphics card can only drive two screens at most (including the laptop's built-in screen). NVIDIA Optimus can be selected instead for configurations with more than one external monitor.\n- OS Detection for NVIDIA Optimus must also be set to Disabled if you want to use NVIDIA Optimus.\n\n"
