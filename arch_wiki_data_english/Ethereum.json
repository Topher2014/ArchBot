This will take a very long time. This time can be shortened with\n\n```\n$ geth --syncmode full --cache=1024\n```\n\nHigher cache values appear to speed up the process more[1].\n\nOptionally, start the client with geth console to get a JavaScript console for more meaningful interaction. This console can then be attached-to from another terminal or remotely with geth attach [hostname:port defaults to localhost].\n\nTo check balances in the console or attach modes, use web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), \"ether\").\n\nTo start CPU mining, use geth --mine. This is far less efficient than GPU mining, and ethereum.org does not recommend it.\n\n"
