      "content": "GX550 comes with a couple of different configurations, so please pay attention to your specific hardware while trying to install it.It comes with dual PCIe-SSDs configured with intel Rapid Storage Technology; i.e. RAID level 0 (Striping). Default operating system is Windows 10 installed in UEFI. Installing Arch will require a complete format / re-partitioning of the disks.\n\nThe NVIDIA graphics cards in this model currently does not seem to work with `nouveau` at all, which means there may be boot freeze's while trying to boot from the default ArchISO, which uses nouveau. best workaround for this would be to completely diable the nvidia gpu and use only intel graphics until installation is complete; or to build a custom archiso with nvidia binary drivers bundled instead off nouveau.\n\nOnce you have obtained a bootable copy of Arch, Start the installation with the following steps.\n\n1. Disable Intel Rapid Storage Technology and change SATA configuration to AHCI from the Asus UEFI BIOS.\n1. Boot from a \"Bootable Arch USB Device\" in UEFI mode.\n1. Format/Partition both SSDs on the device.\n1. Reboot to the \"Bootable Arch USB Device\".\n\nNow, proceed with the standard Installation guide.\n\n"
