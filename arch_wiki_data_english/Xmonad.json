Windows are arranged automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximizing screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard: a mouse is optional.\n\nxmonad is written, configured and extensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other extensions may be written by the user in configuration files.\n\nLayouts are applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on several physical screens.\n\n"

      "content": "Create the ~/.xmonad directory and the ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs file and edit it as described below.\n\nAfter changes to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs are made, use the Mod+q shortcut to recompile and have them take effect.\n\nBecause the xmonad configuration file is written in Haskell, non-programmers may have a difficult time adjusting settings. For detailed HOWTO's and example configurations, we refer you to the following resources:\n\n- xmonad wiki\n- xmonad configuration archive\n- xmonad FAQ\n- Arch Linux forum thread\n\nThe best approach is to only place your changes and customizations in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs and write it such that any unset parameters are picked up from the built-in def function.\n\nThis is achieved by writing an xmonad.hs like this:\n\n```\nimport XMonad\n\nmain = xmonad def\n    { terminal    = \"urxvt\"\n    , modMask     = mod4Mask\n    , borderWidth = 3\n    }\n```\n\nThis simply overrides the default terminal and borderWidth while leaving all other settings at their defaults (inherited from the XConfig value def).\n\nAs things get more complicated, it can be handy to call configuration options by function name inside the main function, and define these separately in their own sections of your ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs. This makes large customizations like your layout and manage hooks easier to visualize and maintain.\n\nThe simple xmonad.hs from above could have been written like this:\n\n```\nimport XMonad\n\nmain = do\n  xmonad $ def\n    { terminal    = myTerminal\n    , modMask     = myModMask\n    , borderWidth = myBorderWidth\n    }\n\nmyTerminal    = \"urxvt\"\nmyModMask     = mod4Mask -- Win key or Super_L\nmyBorderWidth = 3\n```\n\nAlso, order at top level (main, myTerminal, myModMask etc.), or within the {} does not matter in Haskell, as long as imports come first.\n\nThe following is taken from the 0.9 configuration file template. It is an example of the most common functions one might want to define in their main do block.\n\n```\n{\n  terminal           = myTerminal,\n  focusFollowsMouse  = myFocusFollowsMouse,\n  borderWidth        = myBorderWidth,\n  modMask            = myModMask,\n  -- numlockMask deprecated in 0.9.1\n  -- numlockMask        = myNumlockMask,\n  workspaces         = myWorkspaces,\n  normalBorderColor  = myNormalBorderColor,\n  focusedBorderColor = myFocusedBorderColor,\n\n  -- key bindings\n  keys               = myKeys,\n  mouseBindings      = myMouseBindings,\n\n  -- hooks, layouts\n  layoutHook         = myLayout,\n  manageHook         = myManageHook,\n  handleEventHook    = myEventHook,\n  logHook            = myLogHook,\n  startupHook        = myStartupHook\n}\n```\n\nThe package itself also includes a xmonad.hs, which is the latest official example xmonad.hs that comes with the xmonad Haskell module as an example of how to override everything. This should not be used as a template configuration, but as examples of parts you can pick to use in your own configuration. It is located in an architecture and version dependant directory in /usr/share/ (e.g. find /usr/share -name xmonad.hs).\n\n"

You just need to find the Xf86 name of the key (such as XF86PowerDown) and look it up in /usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h. It will give you a keycode (like 0x1008FF2A) which you can use to add a line like the following into list of keybindings in your xmonad.hs:\n\n```\n((0,               0x1008FF2A), spawn \"sudo systemctl suspend\")\n```\n\nYou can also search for the Xf86 key name in Graphics.X11.ExtraTypes.XF86 module, and use its KeySym constant (such as xF86XK_PowerDown) instead of a keycode as shown in the previous example. You will also need to import the module in your xmonad.hs for the key constant to be available.

To do so, right click on the game in your Steam library and choose properties, click on launch options and enter [3]:\n\n```\n-windowed\n```\n\nAnother solution is to float the window of the game using the manage hook. For example, the following line can be used for Half-Life:\n\n```\nclassName =? \"hl_linux\" --> doFloat\n```\n\nThis can also be worked around by making xmonad pay attention to EWMH hints and including its fullscreen hook [4]:\n\n```\nmain = xmonad $ ewmh def{ handleEventHook =\n           handleEventHook def <+> fullscreenEventHook }\n```\n\nThis has a few other effects and makes it behave more akin to fullscreen applications in other WMs.\n\n"
