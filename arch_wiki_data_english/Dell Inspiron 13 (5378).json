See Intel graphics#Loading.\n\nThe Intel Vulkan drivers may cause issues with display managers such as lightdm or sddm if these are running in X: sometimes the machine will boot to a black screen with magenta stripes. These issues can be fixed by reverting to the i915 driver.\n\n"

All the settable options are in a large pane on the right, again. Apply must be clicked to make any changes. Note that the touch screen and the touchpad work in the firmware, and the tabulation and arrow keys also allow cursoring around the different options and buttons. The Tab key alternates between three zones: the menu at the left, the settings pane at the right, and the Apply, Restore Settings, and Exit buttons. The arrow keys must then be used to cursor around the items within each of those zones.\n\nThe firmware contains many radio buttons and check boxes, but these are only in the right pane.\n\nAs of version 371, the UEFI firmware does not have a \"simple\" or \"classic\" switch that can be turned on.\n\nThe boot menu is simple text (not graphical) against a black background.\n\nSee the #Firmware section below for instructions to access the firmware.\n\n"

No keys need to be pressed to switch between headings. The BIOS Setup entry at the bottom.

      "content": "The default fan settings allow the CPU to reach 70-85 Â°C before the fan speeds up. To make the laptop to run cooler, use i8kutilsAUR to manually set the fan start temperature. The BIOS seems to override fan control by default, so install dell-bios-fan-control-gitAUR to give control of the fan to the OS. Note that manually setting the fan profile has a drawback of not letting the fan reach full speed (6000 RPM BIOS control, 5000 RPM manual) since Dell did not publish documentation for the fan.\n\nThis model only has one fan, and it is identified as the right fan. Setting the left fan speed has no effect. A working fan profile using dell-bios-fan-control-gitAUR will look something like this:\n\n```\nset config(0)   {{- 0}  -1  50  -1  50}\nset config(1)   {{- 1}  45  65  45  65}\nset config(2)   {{- 2}  60  75  60  75}\nset config(3)   {{- 2}  70 128  70 128}\n```\n\nSee Fan speed control#Dell laptops for more information.\n\n"
