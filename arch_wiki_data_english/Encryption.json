Examples for block devices are hard drives, flash drives and DVDs.\n\nData-at-rest encryption should only be viewed as an adjunct to the existing security mechanisms of the operating system - focused on securing physical access, while relying on other parts of the system to provide things like network security and user-based access control.\n\n"

      "content": "Data-at-rest encryption ensures that files are always stored on disk in an encrypted form. The files only become available to the operating system and applications in readable form while the system is running and unlocked by a trusted user (data in use or in transit). An unauthorized person looking at the disk contents directly, will only find garbled random-looking data instead of the actual files.\n\nFor example, this can prevent unauthorized viewing of the data when the computer or hard-disk is:\n\n- located in a place to which non-trusted people might gain access while you are away\n- lost or stolen, as with laptops, netbooks or external storage devices\n- in the repair shop\n- discarded after its end-of-life\n\nIn addition, data-at-rest encryption can also be used to add some security against unauthorized attempts to tamper with your operating system – for example, the installation of keyloggers or Trojan horses by attackers who can gain physical access to the system while you are away.\n\nNote: You will still be vulnerable to:\n\nYou will still be vulnerable to:\n\n- Attackers who can break into your system (e.g. over the Internet) while it is running and after you have already unlocked and mounted the encrypted parts of the disk.\n- Attackers who are able to gain physical access to the computer while it is running (even if you use a screenlocker), or very shortly after it was running, if they have the resources to perform a cold boot attack.\n- A government entity, which not only has the resources to easily pull off the above attacks, but also may simply force you to give up your keys/passphrases using various techniques of coercion. In most non-democratic countries around the world, as well as in the USA and UK, it may be legal for law enforcement agencies to do so if they have suspicions that you might be hiding something of interest.\n- Rubber-hose cryptanalysis. Also see XKCD #538\n\nData-at-rest encryption also will not protect you against someone simply wiping your disk. Regular backups are recommended to keep your data safe.\n\nA very strong disk encryption setup (e.g. full system encryption with authenticity checking and no plaintext boot partition) is required to stand a chance against professional attackers who are able to tamper with your system before you use it. And even then it cannot prevent all types of tampering (e.g. hardware keyloggers). The best remedy might be hardware-based full-disk encryption and Trusted Computing.\n\n"

      "content": "While encrypting only the user data itself (often located within the home directory, or on removable media like a data DVD), is the simplest and least intrusive method, it has some significant drawbacks. In modern computer systems, there are many background processes that may cache and store information about user data or parts of the data itself in non-encrypted areas of the hard drive, like:\n\n- swap partitions (potential remedies: disable swapping, or use encrypted swap as well)\n- /tmp (temporary files created by user applications) (potential remedies: avoid such applications; mount /tmp inside a ramdisk)\n- /var (log files and databases and such; for example, locate stores an index of all file names in /var/lib/plocate/plocate.db)\n\n- (potential remedies: disable swapping, or use encrypted swap as well)\n\n- (potential remedies: avoid such applications; mount /tmp inside a ramdisk)\n\nThe solution is to encrypt both system and user data, preventing unauthorized physical access to private data that may be cached by the system. This however comes with the disadvantage that unlocking of the encrypted parts of the disk has to happen at boot time. Another benefit of system data encryption is that it complicates the installation of malware like keyloggers or rootkits for someone with physical access.\n\n"

      "content": "Before setting up encryption on a (part of a) disk, consider securely wiping it first. This consists of overwriting the entire drive or partition with a stream of zero bytes or random bytes, and is done for one or both of the following reasons:\n\nDisk encryption does not change the fact that individual sectors are only overwritten on demand, when the file system creates or modifies the data those particular sectors hold (see #How the encryption works below). Sectors which the filesystem considers \"not currently used\" are not touched, and may still contain remnants of data from previous filesystems. The only way to make sure that all data which you previously stored on the drive can not be recovered, is to manually erase it. For this purpose it does not matter whether zero bytes or random bytes are used (although wiping with zero bytes will be much faster).\n\nIdeally, the whole encrypted part of the disk should be indistinguishable from uniformly random data. This way, no unauthorized person can know which and how many sectors actually contain encrypted data - which may be a desirable goal in itself (as part of true confidentiality), and also serves as an additional barrier against attackers trying to break the encryption. In order to satisfy this goal, wiping the disk using high-quality random bytes is crucial.\n\nThe second goal only makes sense in combination with block device encryption, because in the case of stacked filesystem encryption the encrypted data can easily be located anyways (in the form of distinct encrypted files in the host filesystem). Also note that even if you only intend to encrypt a particular folder, you will have to erase the whole partition if you want to get rid of files that were previously stored in that folder in unencrypted form (due to disk fragmentation). If there are other folders on the same partition, you will have to back them up and move them back afterwards.\n\nOnce you have decided which kind of disk erasure you want to perform, refer to the Securely wipe disk article for technical instructions.\n\n"

      "title": "Stacked filesystem encryption",
      "level": 4,
      "content": "Stacked filesystem encryption solutions are implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem, causing all files written to an encryption-enabled folder to be encrypted on-the-fly before the underlying filesystem writes them to disk, and decrypted whenever the filesystem reads them from disk. This way, the files are stored in the host filesystem in encrypted form (meaning that their contents, and usually also their file/folder names, are replaced by random-looking data of roughly the same length), but other than that they still exist in that filesystem as they would without encryption, as normal files / symlinks / hardlinks / etc.\n\nThe way it is implemented, is that to unlock the folder storing the raw encrypted files in the host filesystem (\"lower directory\"), it is mounted (using a special stacked pseudo-filesystem) onto itself or optionally a different location (\"upper directory\"), where the same files then appear in readable form - until it is unmounted again, or the system is turned off.\n\nAvailable solutions in this category include eCryptfs and EncFS, or one of the cloud-ready options below.\n\nIf you are deploying stacked filesystem encryption to achieve zero-knowledge synchronization with third-party-controlled locations such as cloud-storage services, you may want to consider alternatives to eCryptfs and EncFS, since these are not optimized for transmission of files over the Internet. There are some solutions designed for this purpose instead:\n\n- gocryptfs\n- cryptomatorAUR or cryptomator-binAUR (multi-platform)\n- cryfs\n\nNote that some cloud-storage services offer zero-knowledge encryption directly through their own client applications.\n\n"

      "content": "Block device encryption methods, on the other hand, operate below the filesystem layer and make sure that everything written to a certain block device (i.e. a whole disk, or a partition, or a file acting as a loop device) is encrypted. This means that while the block device is offline, its whole content looks like a large blob of random data, with no way of determining what kind of filesystem and data it contains. Accessing the data happens, again, by mounting the protected container (in this case the block device) to an arbitrary location in a special way.\n\nThe following \"block device encryption\" solutions are available in Arch Linux:\n\n- LUKS, used by default, is an additional convenience layer which stores all of the needed setup information for dm-crypt on the disk itself and abstracts partition and key management in an attempt to improve ease of use and cryptographic security.\n- plain dm-crypt mode, being the original kernel functionality, does not employ the convenience layer. It is more difficult to apply the same cryptographic strength with it. When doing so, longer keys (passphrases or keyfiles) are the result. It has, however, other advantages for very specific cases. For example, a single block device can be segmented and encrypted accordingly.\n\nFor practical implications of the chosen layer of operation, see the #Block device vs stacked filesystem encryption below, as well as the general write up for eCryptfs.

      "content": "For the purposes of disk encryption, each blockdevice (or individual file in the case of stacked filesystem encryption) is divided into sectors of equal length, for example 512 bytes (4096 bits). The encryption/decryption then happens on a per-sector basis, so the n'th sector of the blockdevice/file on disk will store the encrypted version of the n'th sector of the original data.\n\nWhenever the operating system or an application requests a certain fragment of data from the blockdevice/file, the whole sector (or sectors) that contains the data will be read from disk, decrypted on-the-fly, and temporarily stored in memory:\n\n```\n╔═══════╗\n  sector 1 ║\"???..\"║\n           ╠═══════╣         ╭┈┈┈┈┈╮\n  sector 2 ║\"???..\"║         ┊ key ┊\n           ╠═══════╣         ╰┈┈┬┈┈╯\n           :       :            │\n           ╠═══════╣            ▼             ┣┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┫\n  sector n ║\"???..\"║━━━━━━(decryption)━━━━━━━▶┋\"abc..\"┋ sector n\n           ╠═══════╣                          ┣┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┫\n           :       :\n           ╚═══════╝\n\n           encrypted                          unencrypted\n      blockdevice or                          data in RAM\n        file on disk\n```\n\nSimilarly, on each write operation, all sectors that are affected must be re-encrypted completely (while the rest of the sectors remain untouched).\n\nIn order to be able to de/encrypt data, the disk encryption system needs to know the unique secret \"key\" associated with it. Whenever the encrypted block device or folder in question is to be mounted, its corresponding key (called henceforth its \"master key\") must be supplied.\n\nThe entropy of the key is of utmost importance for the security of the encryption. A randomly generated byte string of a certain length, for example 32 bytes (256 bits), has desired properties but is not feasible to remember and apply manually during the mount.\n\nFor that reason two techniques are used as aides. The first is the application of cryptography to increase the entropic property of the master key, usually involving a separate human-friendly passphrase. For the different types of encryption the #Comparison table lists respective features. The second method is to create a keyfile with high entropy and store it on a medium separate from the data drive to be encrypted.\n\nSee also Wikipedia:Authenticated encryption.\n\n"

      "content": "The following are examples how to store and cryptographically secure a master key with a keyfile:\n\nSimply storing the master key in a file (in readable form) is the simplest option. The file - called a \"keyfile\" - can be placed on a USB stick that you keep in a secure location and only connect to the computer when you want to mount the encrypted parts of the disk (e.g. during boot or login).\n\nThe master key (and thus the encrypted data) can be protected with a secret passphrase, which you will have to remember and enter each time you want to mount the encrypted block device or folder. See #Cryptographic metadata below for details.\n\nIn some cases, e.g. when encrypting swap space or a /tmp partition, it is not necessary to keep a persistent master key at all. A new throwaway key can be randomly generated for each session, without requiring any user interaction. This means that once unmounted, all files written to the partition in question can never be decrypted again by anyone - which in those particular use-cases is perfectly fine.\n\n"

      "title": "Cryptographic metadata",

      "content": "Frequently the encryption techniques use cryptographic functions to enhance the security of the master key itself. On mount of the encrypted device the passphrase or keyfile is passed through these and only the result can unlock the master key to decrypt the data.\n\nA common setup is to apply so-called \"key stretching\" to the passphrase (via a \"key derivation function\"), and use the resulting enhanced passphrase as the mount key for decrypting the actual master key (which has been previously stored in encrypted form):\n\n```\n╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮                         ╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮\n ┊ mount passphrase ┊━━━━⎛key derivation⎞━━━━▶┊ mount key ┊\n ╰┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╯ ,──⎝   function   ⎠     ╰┈┈┈┈┈┬┈┈┈┈┈╯\n ╭──────╮            ╱                              │\n │ salt │───────────´                               │\n ╰──────╯                                           │\n ╭──────────────────────╮                           ▼         ╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮\n │ encrypted master key │━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(decryption)━━━━▶┊ master key ┊\n ╰──────────────────────╯                                     ╰┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╯\n```\n\nThe key derivation function (e.g. PBKDF2 or scrypt) is deliberately slow (it applies many iterations of a hash function, e.g. 1000 iterations of HMAC-SHA-512), so that brute-force attacks to find the passphrase are rendered infeasible. For the normal use-case of an authorized user, it will only need to be calculated once per session, so the small slowdown is not a problem. It also takes an additional blob of data, the so-called \"salt\", as an argument - this is randomly generated once during set-up of the disk encryption and stored unprotected as part of the cryptographic metadata. Because it will be a different value for each setup, this makes it infeasible for attackers to speed up brute-force attacks using precomputed tables for the key derivation function.\n\nThe encrypted master key can be stored on disk together with the encrypted data. This way, the confidentiality of the encrypted data depends completely on the secret passphrase.\n\nAdditional security can be attained by instead storing the encrypted master key in a keyfile on e.g. a USB stick. This provides two-factor authentication: Accessing the encrypted data now requires something only you know (the passphrase), and additionally something only you have (the keyfile).\n\nAnother way of achieving two-factor authentication is to augment the above key retrieval scheme to mathematically \"combine\" the passphrase with byte data read from one or more external files (located on a USB stick or similar), before passing it to the key derivation function.The files in question can be anything, e.g. normal JPEG images, which can be beneficial for #Plausible deniability. They are still called \"keyfiles\" in this context, though.\n\nAfter it has been derived, the master key is securely stored in memory (e.g. in a kernel keyring), for as long as the encrypted block device or folder is mounted.\n\nIt is usually not used for de/encrypting the disk data directly, though. For example, in the case of stacked filesystem encryption, each file can be automatically assigned its own encryption key. Whenever the file is to be read/modified, this file key first needs to be decrypted using the main key, before it can itself be used to de/encrypt the file contents:\n\n```\n╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮\n                           ┊ master key ┊\n   file on disk:           ╰┈┈┈┈┈┬┈┈┈┈┈┈╯\n  ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐        │\n  ╎╭───────────────────╮╎        ▼          ╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮\n  ╎│ encrypted file key│━━━(decryption)━━━━▶┊ file key ┊\n  ╎╰───────────────────╯╎                   ╰┈┈┈┈┬┈┈┈┈┈╯\n  ╎┌───────────────────┐╎                        ▼           ┌┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┐\n  ╎│ encrypted file    │◀━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(de/encryption)━━━━━▶┊ readable file ┊\n  ╎│ contents          │╎                                    ┊ contents      ┊\n  ╎└───────────────────┘╎                                    └┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┘\n  └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘\n```\n\nIn a similar manner, a separate key (e.g. one per folder) may be used for the encryption of file names in the case of stacked filesystem encryption.\n\nIn the case of block device encryption one master key is used per device and, hence, all data. Some methods offer features to assign multiple passphrases/keyfiles for the same device and others not. Some use above mentioned functions to secure the master key and others give the control over the key security fully to the user. Two examples are explained by the cryptographic parameters used by dm-crypt in plain or LUKS modes.\n\nWhen comparing the parameters used by both modes one notes that dm-crypt plain mode has parameters relating to how to locate the keyfile (e.g. --keyfile-size, --keyfile-offset). The dm-crypt LUKS mode does not need these, because each blockdevice contains a header with the cryptographic metadata at the beginning. The header includes the used cipher, the encrypted master-key itself and parameters required for its derivation for decryption. The latter parameters in turn result from options used during initial encryption of the master-key (e.g. --iter-time, --use-random).\n\nFor the dis-/advantages of the different techniques, please refer back to #Comparison table or browse the specific pages.\n\nSee also:\n\n- Security#Passwords\n- Wikipedia:Passphrase\n- Wikipedia:Key (cryptography)\n- Wikipedia:Key management\n- Wikipedia:Key derivation function\n\n"

      "content": "The actual algorithm used for translating between pieces of unencrypted and encrypted data (so-called \"plaintext\" and \"ciphertext\") which correspond to each other with respect to a given encryption key, is called a \"cipher\".\n\nDisk encryption employs \"block ciphers\", which operate on fixed-length blocks of data, e.g. 16 bytes (128 bits). At the time of this writing, the predominantly used ones are:\n\nTable content:\n | block size | key size | comment\nAES | 128 bits | 128, 192 or 256 bits | approved by the NSA for protecting \"SECRET\" and \"TOP SECRET\" classified US-government information (when used with a key size of 192 or 256 bits)\nBlowfish | 64 bits | 32–448 bits | one of the first patent-free secure ciphers that became publicly available, hence very well established on Linux\nTwofish | 128 bits | 128, 192 or 256 bits | developed as successor of Blowfish, but has not attained as much widespread usage\nSerpent | 128 bits | 128, 192 or 256 bits | Considered the most secure of the five AES-competition finalists[10][11][12].\n\nEncrypting/decrypting a sector (see above) is achieved by dividing it into small blocks matching the cipher's block-size, and following a certain rule-set (a so-called \"mode of operation\") for how to consecutively apply the cipher to the individual blocks.\n\nSimply applying it to each block separately without modification (dubbed the \"electronic codebook (ECB)\" mode) would not be secure, because if the same 16 bytes of plaintext always produce the same 16 bytes of ciphertext, an attacker could easily recognize patterns in the ciphertext that is stored on disk.\n\nThe most basic (and common) mode of operation used in practice is \"cipher-block chaining (CBC)\". When encrypting a sector with this mode, each block of plaintext data is combined in a mathematical way with the ciphertext of the previous block, before encrypting it using the cipher. For the first block, since it has no previous ciphertext to use, a special pre-generated data block stored with the sector's cryptographic metadata and called an \"initialization vector (IV)\" is used:\n\n```\n╭──────────────╮\n                                   │initialization│\n                                   │vector        │\n                                   ╰────────┬─────╯\n           ╭  ╠══════════╣        ╭─key     │      ┣┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┉┫\n           │  ║          ║        ▼         ▼      ┋          ┋         .

The simplest choice is to calculate it in a predictable fashion from a readily available value such as the sector number. However, this might allow an attacker with repeated access to the system to perform a so-called watermarking attack. To prevent that, a method called \"Encrypted salt-sector initialization vector (ESSIV)\" can be used to generate the initialization vectors in a way that makes them look completely random to a potential attacker.\n\nThere are also a number of other, more complicated modes of operation available for disk encryption, which already provide built-in security against such attacks (and hence do not require ESSIV). Some can also additionally guarantee authenticity of the encrypted data (i.e. confirm that it has not been modified/corrupted by someone who does not have access to the key).\n\nSee also:\n\n- Wikipedia:Disk encryption theory\n- Wikipedia:Block cipher\n- Wikipedia:Block cipher modes of operation\n\n"
