When changing the configuration files, the product name as reported by Xorg has to be known and used. Typically, your M570 should be known as Logitech M570, however, it can be valuable to check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for the match product name.\n\nIn the two configuration files below, only the essential changes are made to get button scrolling to work. Other worthwhile options are:\n\n- Option \"EmulateWheelInertia\" \"5\"\n- Option \"EmulateWheelTimeout\" \"100\"\n\nIt is important to find out if your system is using only evdev or libinput and evdev. See Xorg#Input devices for how to check the driver in use.\n\nChanges made to Xorg configuration files do not take effect until the X session is restarted. To restart the X session, simply log out from your window manager and log back in.\n\n"
