Written in pure bash, CDM has almost no dependencies, yet supports multiple users/sessions and can start virtually any desktop environment or window manager.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Install the cdmAUR package or the cdm-gitAUR package.\n\nNow ensure no other display managers get started by disabling their systemd services.\n\nFor example, if you were using GDM, you would disable gdm.service.\n\nThere is no need to enable a systemd service for CDM. Rather, a script called zzz-cdm.sh will be placed into /etc/profile.d. This script (along with the rest of the scripts in /etc/profile.d) is run when you login to a login shell. However, in order to prevent a scenario where a broken configuration prevents a user from accessing both their desktop and a virtual terminal, the script checks to see which virtual terminal it is being run on, and will by default only run on tty1.\n\nSince the script is placed in the global /etc/profile.d directory, CDM will be run for all users who login on tty1. If you would rather it only run for you, take away executable permissions from /etc/profile.d/zzz-cdm.sh and copy the contents of that file into your ~/.bash_profile for bash, or ~/.zprofile for zsh.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Menu items are configured using three arrays: binlist, namelist and flaglist. Order of items in these arrays is important, items with the same index describe the same menu item. binlist contains commands which are executed, namelist contains names which are shown in the menu and flaglist contains type of the programs specified in binlist, either 'X' for X sessions or 'C' for console programs. Basically X sessions are started using startx (the item in binlist is argument of startx command) and console programs are started using exec.\n\nThere is a sample configuration:\n\n```\nbinlist=(\n  \"~/.xsession\"                                 # Launch your X session,\n  \"/bin/bash --login\"                           # or just execute your shell,\n  \"/usr/bin/fbterm\"                             # or start a frame buffer console,\n  \"/usr/bin/cdm ~/.submenu.cdmrc\"               # or go to a submenuÂ :)\n)\nnamelist=(\"X session\" Console FBTerm \"Sub menu\")\nflaglist=(X C C C)\n```\n\n"
