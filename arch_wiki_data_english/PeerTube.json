Edit the first section of the /etc/peertube/production.yaml. Make sure you change the database password to match the one you set earlier.\n1. Start/enable the Redis service.\n1. If you want to edit the settings through the web UI, you must change the ownership of the configuration folder: # chown -R peertube:peertube /etc/peertube\n1. (Optional) Configure and start a reverse proxy. PeerTube has official support for nginx, and the configuration file can be found at /usr/share/webapps/peertube/support/nginx/peertube Make sure you change the file paths to the ones used by this package.\n1. (Optional) If you are having trouble with getting the package to work, fix possible permissions problems: # chown -R peertube:peertube /var/lib/peertube/\n\n```\n# chown -R peertube:peertube /etc/peertube\n```\n\n```\n/usr/share/webapps/peertube/support/nginx/peertube\n```\n\n```\n# chown -R peertube:peertube /var/lib/peertube/\n```\n\nFinally, start the peertube service and point your browser to the URL from the configuration file (http://localhost:9000 by default without a reverse proxy).\n\n"
