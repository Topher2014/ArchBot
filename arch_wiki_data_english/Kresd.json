If the resolver should be accessible from other hosts, configure other network interfaces in /etc/knot-resolver/kresd.conf with net.listen(). Refer to Knot Resolver documentation for more information.\n\nIf the resolver should respect entries from the /etc/hosts file, add a hints.add_hosts() line to /etc/knot-resolver/kresd.conf.\n\n"

Disable the dnsmasq DNS functionality (port=0), or assign a different port to either service.\n\n"
