      "level": 2,
      "content": "The UX51Vz comes in a variety of configurations, most of those sold in western Europe come with two SSDs (2x128GB or 2x256GB) in an Intel Rapid Storage (aka Intel Matrix) RAID 0 configuration. To install Arch Linux on the UX51Vz, you can follow the official Installation guide. Since the UX51Vz uses UEFI and GPT, make sure to also read the UEFI, GPT and Arch boot process#Boot loader pages. The only way to preserve the pre-installed Windows instance is to install Arch with RAID without breaking up the RAID 0 array. See RAID with the only difference that you should not create arrays, only assemble.\n\nTo report the RAID information from the Option ROM (for instance \"Intel(R) Matrix Storage Manager\"):\n\n```\nmdadm --detail-platform\n```\n\nTo get general details:\n\n```\nmdadm -D /dev/md127\n```\n\nTo examine information (including members):\n\n```\nmdadm -E /dev/md127\n```\n\nThis is the important part that uses imsm (Intel Matrix) metadata! To assemble the RAID array inside the container, and/or to start it (the -e option declares the style of RAID metadata (superblock) to be used):\n\n```\nmdadm -I -e imsm /dev/md127\n```\n\nTo check the current state:\n\n```\ncat /proc/mdstat\n```\n\nTo add it to the configuration file (to be activated automagically at boot):\n\n```\nmdadm --examine --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf\n```\n\nThen proceed with partitioning and file systems creation as usual.\n\n"

      "content": "For automatic powersaving when on battery configure Laptop Mode Tools. For manual power saving see Power saving. Also check out Powertop.\n\nThe UX51Vz can run a little hot, this is especially true for the HiDPI variant (aka UX51VZH) because the discrete GPU is always on. Be sure to check out Linux Thermal Daemon[dead link 2024-07-30 â“˜] (available as thermald in the AUR), which proactively controls thermal using P-states, T-states, and the Intel power clamp driver. It can do wonders for temperature management while avoiding to spin up the fans.\n\n"
