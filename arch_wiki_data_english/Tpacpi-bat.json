Much like the /proc filesystem, you can read and write information to these files to get information about and send commands to the hardware. tp_smapi is highly recommended if you are using a supported ThinkPad laptop.\n\n"

Use tpacpi-batAUR or tpacpi-bat-gitAUR.\n\n"

      "title": "Control battery charging",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "It is bad for most laptop batteries to hold a full charge for long periods of time. [1] You should try to keep your battery in the 40-80% charged range, unless you need the battery life for extended periods of time.\n\n"
    },
    {
      "title": "General way",
      "level": 4,
      "content": "tp_smapi lets you control the start and stop charging threshold to do just that. Run these commands to set these to good values:\n\n```\n# echo 40 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh\n# echo 80 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh\n```\n\nThis will cause the battery to begin charging when it falls below 40% charge and stop charging once it exceeds 80% charge. This will extend the lifetime of your battery.\n\nNote that when you remove and re-insert the battery, these thresholds may be reset to their default values. To work around this, create a script to set these values, and make this script run both at startup and when a battery is inserted. More specific instructions follow.\n\nCreate a script:\n\n```\n/usr/sbin/set_battery_thresholds\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# set the battery charging thresholds to extend battery lifespan\necho ${2:-40} > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT${1:-0}/start_charge_thresh\necho ${3:-80} > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT${1:-0}/stop_charge_thresh\n```\n\nMake it executable. With this script to set a battery threshold is very simple, just type (if set_battery_thresholds is the name of the script):\n\n```\nset_battery_thresholds 0 96 100\n```\n\nOr run it with no arguments to default to BAT0, and thresholds of 40% and 80%.\n\nLet systemd execute the script at startup. Thus, create the tp_smapi_set_battery_thresholds.service unit and enable/start it afterwards:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/tp_smapi_set_battery_thresholds.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Set Battery Charge Thresholds by tp_smapi\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/sbin/set_battery_thresholds\nRemainAfterExit=yes\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nYou can also make it run when a battery is inserted. This requires that acpid is installed and running. Edit /etc/acpi/handler.sh:\n\n```\n#... other ACPI stuff\nbattery)\n  case \"$2\" in\n    BAT0)\n      case \"$4\" in\n        00000000)\n        ;;\n        00000001)\n        /usr/sbin/set_battery_thresholds\n        ;;\n#... more ACPI stuff\n```\n\n"
