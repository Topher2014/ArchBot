The legacy boot mode is provided by the SeaBIOS payload of coreboot. SeaBIOS behaves like a traditional BIOS that boots into the MBR of a disk, and from there into your standard boot loaders like Syslinux and GRUB.\n\nThe instructions for getting Arch Linux to work on this machine are similar to the Acer C720 Chromebook, with a few differences.\n\n"
