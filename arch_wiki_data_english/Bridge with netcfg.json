Of course, edit br0, eth0 and tap0 to your needs.\n\n```\n/etc/netctl/bridge\n```\n\n```\nDescription=\"Example Bridge connection\"\nInterface=br0\nConnection=bridge\nBindsToInterfaces=(eth0 tap0)\nIP=dhcp\n```\n\nThis example creates a statically assigned bridge called br0 which has real Ethernet adapter eth0 connected to it. Edit Interface, BindsToInterfaces, MACAddress, Address, and Gateway according to your needs.\n\n```\n/etc/netctl/bridge\n```\n\n```\nDescription=\"Example Bridge connection\"\nInterface=br0\nConnection=bridge\nBindsToInterfaces=(eth0)\nMACAddress='12:34:56:78:90'\nIP=static\nAddress='192.168.10.20/24'\nGateway='192.168.10.200'\n## Ignore (R)STP and immediately activate the bridge\nSkipForwardingDelay=yes\n```\n\nYou can bridge any combination of network devices editing BindsToInterfaces option.\n\nIf any of the bridged devices (e.g. eth0, tap0) had dhcpcd enabled, stop and disable the dhcpcd@eth0.service daemon. Or set IP=no to the netctl profiles.\n\nFinally, start and enable your /etc/netctl/bridge.\n\n"
