Easiest way to get started fast is to install dlang-dmd package group. It will provide the official compiler (dmd), the standard library libphobos and dtools, a collection of small development tools.\n\n"

You should then be able to execute the program with:\n\n```\n$ ./hello\n```\n\nYou can also execute\n\n```\n$ dmd -run hello.d\n```\n\nwhich will simply compile and run without leaving any object files in the directory.\n\n"

The reference implementation is dmd, but gcc-d (D frontend for GCC) and ldc (LLVM D Compiler) are also available.\n\nAs of April 2017 dmd's backend is now FOSS (Boost-licensed). All compilers share the same front-end code and thus have almost identical support for language features (assuming same front-end version).\n\n"
