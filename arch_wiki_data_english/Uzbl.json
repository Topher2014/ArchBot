      "content": "Uzbl is a lightweight browser based on uzbl-core. Uzbl adheres to the UNIX philosophy of \"Write programs that do one thing and do it well\". The uzbl-browser package includes uzbl-core, uzbl-browser and uzbl-event-manager. Most users will want to use uzbl-browser or uzbl-tabbed as they provide the fullest set of tools for browsing. Uzbl-browser allows for a single page per window (with as many windows as you want), while uzbl-tabbed provides a wrapper for uzbl-browser and implements basic tabs with multiple pages per window.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "One of the biggest advantages of using Uzbl is that nearly everything can be controlled by the keyboard. This is preferable to the traditional mouse/keyboard combo because less moving around of the hands is needed. Vim users will find Uzbl much easier to pick-up, especially as the default bindings loosely resemble Vim keystrokes. For instance, following a link requires the user to type fl, and then the keystrokes in the box that appears next to each link on the page. Shortening the command to just f in the configuration file allows for even faster navigation.\n\nBelow are basic, default commands that can be used with uzbl-browser and uzbl-tabbed. These commands can all be found in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uzbl/config (which is usually located in ~/.config/uzbl/config). The default settings work well, but many users like to edit them to suit their preferences and in fact, it is encouraged to change this file to suit your needs. More help with editing the configuration file can be found on the Uzbl readme.\n\n"
