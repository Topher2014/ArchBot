It scans for rootkits, and other possible vulnerabilities. It does so by searching for the default directories (of rootkits), misconfigured permissions, hidden files, kernel modules containing suspicious strings, and comparing hashes of important files with known good ones.\n\nIt is written in Bash, to allow for portability, and can run on most UNIX-based systems.\n\n"
