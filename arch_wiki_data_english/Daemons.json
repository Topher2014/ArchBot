A good example is a web server that waits for a request to deliver a page, or an ssh server waiting for someone trying to log in. While these are full featured applications, there are daemons whose work is not that visible. Daemons are for tasks like writing messages into a log file (e.g. syslog, metalog) or keeping your system time accurate (e.g. ntpd). For more information see daemon(7).\n\n"

      "content": "Units commonly include, but are not limited to, services (.service), mount points (.mount), devices (.device) and sockets (.socket).\n\nWhen using systemctl, you generally have to specify the complete name of the unit file, including its suffix, for example sshd.socket. There are however a few short forms when specifying the unit in the following systemctl commands:\n\n- If you do not specify the suffix, systemctl will assume .service. For example, netctl and netctl.service are equivalent.\n- Mount points will automatically be translated into the appropriate .mount unit. For example, specifying /home is equivalent to home.mount.\n- Similar to mount points, devices are automatically translated into the appropriate .device unit, therefore specifying /dev/sda2 is equivalent to dev-sda2.device.\n\nSee systemd.unit(5) for details.\n\nThe commands in the below table operate on system units since --system is the implied default for systemctl. To instead operate on user units (for the calling user), use systemctl --user without root privileges. See also systemd/User#Basic setup to enable/disable user units for all users.\n\n- Most commands also work if multiple units are specified, see systemctl(1) for more information.\n- The --now switch can be used in conjunction with enable, disable, and mask to respectively start, stop, or mask the unit immediately rather than after rebooting.\n- A package may offer units for different purposes. If you just installed a package, pacman -Qql package | grep -Fe .service -e .socket can be used to check and find them.\n- When available, enabling unit.socket instead of unit.service might be beneficial because the socket would start the service when necessary.

Do not use this type if other services need to be ordered on this service, unless it is socket activated.\n- Type=forking: systemd considers the service started up once the process forks and the parent has exited. For classic daemons, use this type unless you know that it is not necessary. You should specify PIDFile= as well so systemd can keep track of the main process.\n- Type=oneshot: this is useful for scripts that do a single job and then exit. You may want to set RemainAfterExit=yes as well so that systemd still considers the service as active after the process has exited. Setting RemainAfterExit=yes is appropriate for the units which change the system state (e.g., mount some partition). See also [1] for the differences of simple and oneshot.\n- Type=notify: identical to Type=simple, but with the stipulation that the daemon will send a signal to systemd when it is ready. The reference implementation for this notification is provided by libsystemd-daemon.so.\n- Type=dbus: the service is considered ready when the specified BusName appears on DBus's system bus.\n- Type=idle: systemd will delay execution of the service binary until all jobs are dispatched.

Check if this is the case with systemctl is-enabled NetworkManager-wait-online.service. If it is not enabled, then reenable NetworkManager.service.\n- In the case of netctl, enable the netctl-wait-online.service (unless you are using netctl-auto; see FS#75836).\n- If using systemd-networkd, systemd-networkd-wait-online.service should be enabled together with systemd-networkd.service. Check if this is the case with systemctl is-enabled systemd-networkd-wait-online.service. If it is not enabled, then reenable systemd-networkd.service.\n\nFor more detailed explanations, see the discussion in the Network configuration synchronization points.\n\nIf a service needs to perform DNS queries, it should additionally be ordered after nss-lookup.target:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/foo.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\n...\nWants=network-online.target\nAfter=network-online.target nss-lookup.target\n...\n```\n\nSee systemd.special(7) ยง Special Passive System Units.\n\nFor nss-lookup.target to have any effect it needs a service that pulls it in via Wants=nss-lookup.target and orders itself before it with Before=nss-lookup.target. Typically this is done by local DNS resolvers.\n\nCheck which active service, if any, is pulling in nss-lookup.target with:\n\n```\n$ systemctl list-dependencies --reverse nss-lookup.target\n```\n\n"

      "content": "In order to notify about service failures, an OnFailure= directive needs to be added to the according service file, for example by using a drop-in configuration file. Adding this directive to every service unit can be achieved with a top-level drop-in configuration file. For details about top-level drop-ins, see systemd.unit(5).\n\nCreate a top-level drop-in for services:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/service.d/toplevel-override.conf\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nOnFailure=failure-notification@%n.service\n```\n\nThis adds OnFailure=failure-notification@%n.service to every service file. If some_service_unit fails, failure-notification@some_service_unit.service will be started to handle the notification delivery (or whatever task it is configured to perform).\n\nCreate the failure-notification@.service template unit:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/failure-notification@.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Send a notification about a failed systemd unit\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/path/to/failure-notification.sh %i\n# runs as a temporary user/group and enables several other security precautions\nDynamicUser=true\n```\n\nYou can create the failure-notification.sh script and define what to do or how to notify. Examples include sending e-mail, showing desktop notifications, using gotify, XMPP, etc. The %i will be the name of the failed service unit and will be passed as an argument to the script.\n\nIn order to prevent a recursion for starting instances of failure-notification@.service again and again if the start fails, create an empty drop-in configuration file with the same name as the top-level drop-in (the empty service-level drop-in configuration file takes precedence over the top-level drop-in and overrides the latter one):\n\n```\n# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/failure-notification@.service.d\n# touch /etc/systemd/system/failure-notification@.service.d/toplevel-override.conf\n```\n\n"

      "content": "You can set up systemd to send an e-mail when a unit fails. Cron sends mail to MAILTO if the job outputs to stdout or stderr, but many jobs are setup to only output on error. First you need two files: an executable for sending the mail and a .service for starting the executable. For this example, the executable is just a shell script using sendmail, which is in packages that provide smtp-forwarder.\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/systemd-email\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/usr/bin/sendmail -t <<ERRMAIL\nTo: $1\nFrom: systemd <root@$HOSTNAME>\nSubject: $2\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n\n$(systemctl status --full \"$2\")\nERRMAIL\n```\n\nWhatever executable you use, it should probably take at least two arguments as this shell script does: the address to send to and the unit file to get the status of. The .service we create will pass these arguments:\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/status_email_user@.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=status email for %i to user\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/systemd-email address %i\nUser=nobody\nGroup=systemd-journal\n```\n\nWhere user is the user being emailed and address is that user's email address. Although the recipient is hard-coded, the unit file to report on is passed as an instance parameter, so this one service can send email for many other units. At this point you can start status_email_user@dbus.service to verify that you can receive the emails.\n\nThen simply edit the service you want emails for and add OnFailure=status_email_user@%n.service to the [Unit] section. %n passes the unit's name to the template.\n\n- If you set up sSMTP security according to sSMTP#Security the user nobody will not have access to /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf, and the systemctl start status_email_user@dbus.service command will fail. One solution is to use root as the User in the status_email_user@.service unit.\n- If you try to use mail -s somelogs address in your email script, mail will fork and systemd will kill the mail process when it sees your script exit. Make the mail non-forking by doing mail -Ssendwait -s somelogs address.\n\n"

Metadata fields for the journal such as _SYSTEMD_UNIT and _COMM are collected asynchronously and rely on the /proc directory for the process existing. Fixing this requires fixing the kernel to provide this data via a socket connection, similar to SCM_CREDENTIALS. In short, it is a bug.
