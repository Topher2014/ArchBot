Your tracefile will be created in your /tmp directory.\n\nNote: **very fast** \n\nVOGL ships with various OpenGL samples that can be used for testing in its sources. These are not part of the package but they can be built manually. You can also grab the latest OpenGL samples from the OpenGL Samples Pack or from OpenGL SuperBible.\n\n"
