      "title": "No sound after Windows reboot",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "There seems to be a bug in the firmware that prevents the embedded sound card from working in Arch after Windows has been restarted. The sound system works, and you can hear sounds from, say, wireless headphones, but the embedded sound card either plays no sounds at all, or plays sounds for a couple seconds before quickly \"fading out\" to silence.\n\nUnlike some other models, suspending and resuming makes no difference. Instead, following are the known workarounds:\n\n- If you have not exited Windows yet and plan to boot into Arch next, do a Windows shutdown instead of restart, and then boot into Arch.\n- If you are already booted into Arch, do an Arch shutdown/poweroff and then boot back into it (an Arch reboot will not work).\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if the sound card is not working, boot into Arch via a complete shutdown (as opposed to a restart) to fix it.\n\n"
