This method is quite untrustworthy, as the remote host can simply choose to lie.\n\nSo you have two choices:\n\n- Tell the truth (see #oidentd below)\n- Tell a little white lie (see #nullIdentd below)\n\n"

One use for such a simple service would be for IRC client connections to ensure a degree of privacy (remote IRC server and users do not know your username) as well as allowing a small degree of 'vanity plating' for use in IRC channels.\n\nThe original code suffered link rot, but may now be found on GitHub, at this address https://github.com/dxtr/nullidentd.\n\n"
