To change the default terminal emulator, run kcmshell6 componentchooser and select your Terminal Emulator or write the launch command into the selection field in the Other... popup. (The second option will create a new local desktop entry for this command.)\n\nFor example, to launch tmux in alacritty inside Dolphin, type alacritty -e tmux after selecting Other....\n\nThe setting can also be directly changed by modifying the configuration file ~/.config/kdeglobals. For example, to use alacritty add in the [General] section:\n\n```\nTerminalApplication=alacritty\nTerminalService=Alacritty.desktop\n```\n\nWhere TerminalApplication takes a command and TerminalService a desktop entry (TerminalService seems to be optional). Note, that this does not influence the terminal within the dolphin window (opened with F4).\n\nNote: **The factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed.** The factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed.\n\nThe factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed.\n\nTo change the internal Dolphin terminal window go to Keyboard > Shortcuts and choose your preferred terminal and set the Launch shortcut to Ctrl+Alt+T, overriding Konsole's shortcut. Note that terminals opened this way might not follow the background color as specified in the terminal's configuration file, but otherwise should be identical to an instance launched in a window.\n\n"

Baloo indexes these tags into its own database to allow for faster searching and maintains a list of all known tags. Activate Baloo to show a list of all indexed tags within the Places panel and make searching for files by their tags possible.\n\n"

      "content": "For moving files into the Trash, it is required that the user has exclusive access rights to the Trash. The rationale being that you do not want that others can see what you deleted. For that, a folder such as .Trash-1000/ is created on the external drive, with permission mode 700.\n\nIf the correct access permissions cannot be set, dolphin will (unlike GNOME) move the files to the trash in the home directory, which takes time.\n\nTo mount USB-Sticks / external HDDs, Dolphin uses Udisks. FAT32 / EXFAT / NTFS do not support UNIX file permission, udisk mounts them by default with mode 755. To configure udisks to mount these drives with mode 700, have a look at the file /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf.example. Copy the file (the name should end with .conf), uncomment the relevant part and add for the three filesystems to the lines with xyz_defaults the options fmask=177,dmask=077.\n\n(Background information: [3], [4])\n\n"

This is because Dolphin reads the folder view's background color from the [Colors:View] section in ~/.config/kdeglobals. Change the following line to the RGB value you prefer (it may be given in the form #RRGGBB or R,G,B):\n\n```\n~/.config/kdeglobals\n```\n\n```\n...\n[Colors:View]\nBackgroundNormal=#2E2E2E\n...\n```\n\nIf you get a blue border around the folder view pane (if you are in split view it will only be around the focused pane), you may get rid of it by applying the fusion-fixes.qss style sheet via the qt6ct app. This answer describes what to do to get the adwaita dark theme working for dolphin under Gnome.\n\nAlternatively, use kvantum to manage your Qt6 theming.

The --noincremental argument is optional. XDG_MENU_PREFIX is needed, because archlinux-xdg-menu creates a XDG Desktop Menu with an arch- prefix (see xdg-menu).\n\nThe XDG Desktop Menu files can be found in /etc/xdg/menus/*-applications.menu.\n\nNormally, kbuildsycoca6 does not need to be installed as it is part of the kservice package, which is a dependency of dolphin.\n\nNote: **not** \n\n"
