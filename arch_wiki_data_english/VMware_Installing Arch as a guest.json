It acts like a \"balloon\" that can be inflated to reclaim physical pages by reserving them in the guest and invalidating them in the monitor, freeing up the underlying machine pages so they can be allocated to other guests. It can also be deflated to allow the guest to use more physical memory. Deallocated Virtual Machine memory can be reused in the host without terminating the guest.\n- vmw_pvscsi - For VMware's Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI) HBA.\n- vmw_vmci - The Virtual Machine Communication Interface. It enables high-speed communication between host and guest in a virtual environment via the VMCI virtual device.\n- vmwgfx - For 3D acceleration. This is a KMS enabled DRM driver for the VMware SVGA2 virtual hardware.\n- vmxnet3 - For VMware's vmxnet3 virtual ethernet NIC.\n- a fuse-based hgfs implementation has been added to open-vm-tools 10.0+ and is supported from kernel version 4.0+.\n\nThe following drivers are only needed if you are running Arch Linux on a hypervisor like VMware vSphere Hypervisor[dead link 2024-07-30 ⓘ]. Client-server applications can write to the VMCI Sock (vsock) interface to make use of the VMCI virtual device, when communicating between virtual machines.\n\n- vsock - The Virtual Socket Protocol. It is similar to the TCP/IP socket protocol, allowing communication between Virtual Machines and hypervisor or host.\n- vmw_vsock_vmci_transport - Implements a VMCI transport for Virtual Sockets.\n\nSome modules, such as the legacy vmhgfs shared folder module, will require additional work to manually compile and systemd enable in order to function properly.\n\n"

However, now the drivers for the network/SCSI adapter are part of the Linux kernel.\n\nThe official VMware Tools also had the advantage of being able to use the Unity mode feature, but as of VMWare Workstation 12, Unity mode for Linux guests has been removed due to lack of use and developer difficulties in maintaining the feature.
