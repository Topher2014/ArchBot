More in-depth help can be found at Help:Contents on MediaWiki and Help:Contents on Wikipedia.\n\nThis is a short tutorial about editing the ArchWiki. Before editing or creating pages, users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the general tone, layout, and style of existing articles. An effort should be made to maintain a level of consistency throughout the wiki. See ArchWiki:Contributing, Help:Reading and Help:Style for an overview of the common conventions.\n\nTo experiment with editing, please use the sandbox. For an overview of wiki markup, see Help:Cheatsheet.\n\n"

Note: All edits should be accompanied by a descriptive summary to facilitate reviewing from other users. See ArchWiki:Contributing#The 3 fundamental rules for more information.\n1. Use the Show preview button to facilitate proofreading and verify formatting before saving.\n1. Mark the edit as minor by checking the This is a minor edit box if the edit is superficial and indisputable.\n1. Save changes by clicking Save changes.

Revert the edit first, then make additional changes; do not edit the revision preview.\n- Consider using an especially detailed and verbose edit summary when performing an undo to prevent lengthy discussions.\n\n"

Irrelevant or unhelpful articles will be deleted.\n- Is your topic of interest to others? Consider not only what you wish to write about, but also what others may wish to read. Personal notes belong on your user page.\n- Is your topic worthy of a new page? Search the wiki for similar articles. If they exist, consider improving or adding a section to an existing article instead.\n- Will your contribution be significant? Avoid creating stubs unless planning to expand them shortly thereafter.\n\nCreating a new page requires selection of a descriptive title and an appropriate category.\n\nPlease read Help:Article naming guidelines and Help:Style#Title for article naming advice. Do not include \"Arch Linux\" or variations in page titles. This is the Arch Linux wiki; it is assumed that articles will be related to Arch Linux (e.g., \"Installing Openbox\"; not \"Installing Openbox in Arch Linux\").\n\nVisit the Table of contents to help choose an appropriate category. Articles may belong to multiple categories, as long as one category is not already the parent of the other (see Help:Style#Categories).\n\nTo add a new page to some category (say \"My new page\" to \"Some category\") you need to:\n\n1. Create a page with your new title by browsing to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/My_new_page (remember to replace \"My_new_page\" with the intended title!)\n1. Add [[Category:Some category]] to the top of your page\n\nAt this stage the new article is still considered an orphan. To complete the job, take a little extra time to link to the new article from others: this will improve its visibility and encourage more users to contribute to it. Likely candidates are articles about related software, more generic overview pages, or even simple lists such as List of applications.\n\nIn some cases it may make sense to instead create a subpage, i.e. a child of another page: subpage titles are separated from the superpage title with \"/\" symbols (slash). This is often useful to prepare drafts under one's own User page, for example https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:Myself/My_new_subpage.\n\n"

For example, adding the word __NOTOC__ anywhere in an article will prevent generation of a table of contents. Similarly, the word __TOC__ can be used to alter the default position of the table of contents. See Help:Magic words for details.\n\nTemplates and variables are predefined portions of wikitext that can be inserted into an article to aid in formatting content.\n\nVariables are defined by the system and can be used to display information about the current page, wiki, or date. For example, use {{SITENAME}} to display the wiki's site name (here it displayed as \"ArchWiki\"). To set an alternate title header for the current page, another wiki variable can be used: {{DISPLAYTITLE:New Title}}. (But it's very restricted: you are only allowed to change first letter to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores — normalized title string must match with real page name, otherwise it will not work; use {{Lowercase title}} template to display first letter of title in lower case).\n\nTemplates, on the other hand, are user-defined. The content of any page can be included in another page by adding {{Namespace:Page Name}} to an article, but this is rarely used with pages outside the Template namespace. (If the namespace is omitted, Template is assumed.) For example, Template:Note, which can be included in an article with the following wikitext:\n\n```\n{{Note|This is a note.}}\n```\n\n...is rendered as:\n\nSee Help:Template for more information and a list of available templates such as Template:Tip or Template:Warning.\n\n"
