In order to reach that goal we have to organize the job in a rational and functional way: this article tries to explain schematically what are the most important tasks you can give your help to accomplish.\n\nThis is a community effort, but if you take on the task seriously, a formal position as a wiki maintainer may be in order.\n\n"

Those familiar with collaborative software projects will easily understand the analogy between wiki edit summaries and git commit messages, and between wiki edit diffs and git diffs.\n\n"

      "title": "Always properly use the edit summary",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The edit summary is the little text box that is found below the main editing area and just above the Save changes or Save page button. It is very important to always write, in a succinct way, what has been done and why. Note that internal wiki links do work in edit summaries, so use them to link to any related discussions or articles; similarly, paste any URLs to relevant edit diffs or external resources, such as forum threads or mailing lists.\n\nOnly in case of minor edits, e.g. grammar or orthography corrections or the simple rewording of a sentence, the \"why\" part can be omitted; analogously, starting a new discussion or replying to an existing one does not require to restate the message in the edit summary.\n\n- Take a look at the edit summaries in the Recent Changes to get an idea of what you should write in your summary, but be warned that unfortunately not all users are aware of these guidelines.\n- Use links like Special:Diff/359881/next for clickable references to diffs, see mw:Help:Diff for syntax details.\n\n"

      "content": "If you want to make an extensive change to a page, be it a normal article or a discussion page, always split your work in several simple edits, for example according to the various logical steps needed to complete it. If in doubt, preview the resulting diff with the Show changes button and wonder if another user would be able to understand it, also considering the edit summary as explained above. Some common operations that generate confusing diffs are:\n\n- Moving a section in an article and at the same time editing its content. Solution: move the section unchanged, save, and change its content in a following edit.\n- Reordering several sections of an article at the same time. Solution: move only one section per edit.\n\n"

      "title": "The most important task",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "In the remainder of this article you will be presented with the various ways you can contribute to the wiki. Among them, however, there is one that you should consider far more important than the others: add your favorite articles to your watchlist and protect them against counter-productive edits.\n\nEvery day, ArchWiki receives several dozens of edits from many different users: while most of these changes are actual improvements, it only takes one single edit, often made in good faith, to inaccurately alter the meaning of a whole paragraph or a section, or sometimes even unreasonably delete it altogether; if gone unnoticed, this will ruin the valuable work that you and all the other previous editors had done. Unfortunately, this occurs more frequently than you would expect: the official wiki staff does try their best to filter and fix counter-productive edits, but you should never rely completely on them, both because, just like you, they have limited time to spend on the wiki, and also because they are not omniscient, and it is very likely that your knowledge on the topics treated in your favorite articles is greater than theirs. In general, a wiki simply does not work if users only focus on writing new content but then do not care about what happens to their contributions.\n\nFortunately, there is a very easy way for you to follow the articles to which you contributed or those that you like the most or are most knowledgeable in: at the top of every article there is a \"watch\" link, and by following it, that article will be added to your watchlist. You will then be able to follow the changes in Special:Watchlist, or by choosing to be notified by email when the watched articles receive updates in the \"Email options\" field of Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-personal-email; the pages you are following will also be highlighted in bold in Special:RecentChanges. Finally, preferences for the watchlist are found in Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist: among the options you can even choose to automatically start watching the pages that you create or edit.\n\nIf you notice that an article in your watchlist has received an inaccurate edit, or you just do not understand it, you are strongly encouraged to either fix it, if possible, or to start a discussion in the article's talk page, or in the responsible author's talk page. To keep up-to-date, you can configure web-/email notifications for talk topics via Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-echo.\n\n"
