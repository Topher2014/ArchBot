This can be observed for example by entering a virtual console and executing systemctl suspend there. Even before the device enters to suspend state ATA related messages can be seen on the console and the device hangs on resume.\n\nCheck current policys with:\n\n```\ncat /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy\n```\n\nChange policys to max_performance before suspending to RAM:\n\n```\necho max_performance > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy\necho max_performance > /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy\n```\n\nThe easiest workaround is to use TLP for power management governing with max_performance set for both SATA ALPM settings in /etc/default/tlp\n\n```\n# SATA aggressive link power management (ALPM):\n#   min_power, medium_power, max_performance\nSATA_LINKPWR_ON_AC=max_performance\nSATA_LINKPWR_ON_BAT=max_performance\n```\n\n"
