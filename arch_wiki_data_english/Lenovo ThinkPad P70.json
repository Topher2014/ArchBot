Lenovo provides a bootable, standalone \"BIOS Update CD\" to perform this update outside of Windows.\n1. Getting into the BIOS is difficult, so here are some instructions that seemed to work. The easiest way was through Windows 10.\n1. In the BIOS, you will want to disable UEFI Secure Boot, change the boot order to look at USB devices first, allow F12 to bypass the BIOS, and possibly enable the verbose mode because it is easier to press the appropriate buttons on time.\n\n"

HDMI has also been confirmed to work using Bumblebee and intel-virtual-output.\n\nLimited testing suggests that a maximum of 3 total displays from 2 output types may be used at one time. For example, two external DP/USB-C displays and the one internal display will achieve the maximum of three.\n\n"
