Following the Unix Philosophy, nmh is made up by a collection of simple programs each of which has a single purpose. This architecture allows the user to intersperse nmh with other commands at the shell prompt and to write scripts tailored to their needs.\n\n"

      "title": "Configuring",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "nmh is extensively configurable in a variety of ways. The primary of these is the ~/.mh_profile file.\n\nThe syntax for ~/.mh_profile is unusual. For example, nmh will refuse to run if there are blank lines in the file. Read the mh_profile(5) page for more.\n\nBy default, nmh uses ~/Mail as your mail folder. To change this, set Path:\n\n```\nPath: path/to/mail/folder\n```\n\n- Path can be either full (if prefixed with /) or relative to $HOME.\n- Nmh uses the mh mail format, which is different from the maildir and mbox. Setting your Path to a preexisting maildir folder, for example, will not work.\n\nSet inbox (relative to Path):\n\n```\nInbox: inbox\n```\n\nAlso by default, nmh populates the mail folder with the inc command, which incorporates mail from the user's mail drop (/var/mail/user).\n\nIf you have a non-standard mail drop path, you can set an environment variable $MAILDROP, or set MailDrop in mh_profile:\n\n```\nMailDrop: /path/to/mail-drop\n```\n\nor set inc:\n\n```\ninc: -file /path/to/mail-drop\n```\n\nNmh is also capable of retrieving mail via POP. A basic POP setup (see inc(1) for more):\n\n```\ninc: -host example.com -user username -sasl\n```\n\n"
