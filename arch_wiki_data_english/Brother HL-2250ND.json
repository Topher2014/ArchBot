      "level": 3,
      "content": "Some of the PPD files in epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2AUR are missing paper size definitions for media that is supported by the printers and the filter. It is relatively straightforward to add the missing media types to the PPD files.\n\nTo begin, download the PKGBUILD for the epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2AUR package, either with an AUR helper or from a snapshot tarball. Once in the directory with the PKGBUILD, download and extract the source of the package by running makepkg --nobuild.\n\nChange directory to src/epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-$PKGVER. Open the file src/optBase.h in a text editor for reference.\n\nIdentify the PPD used by your printer in the ppd directory. For example, a Workforce 7710 printer uses Epson-WF-7710_Series-epson-escpr2-en.ppd. Let us call it your_ppd_filename. Convert the relevant PPD to a PPD compiler source file using the ppdi utility from the cups package.\n\n```\n$ ppdi -o your_ppd_filename.drv ppd/your_ppd_filename.ppd\n```\n\nOpen the newly-created your_ppd_filename.drv in a text editor. Identify the section of the file with a lot of lines starting with CustomMedia. Duplicate one such line to modify. For example:\n\n```\nCustomMedia \"Legal/US Legal\" 612.00 1008.00 8.40 8.40 8.40 8.40 \"<</PageSize[612.00 1008.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\" \"<</PageRegion[612.00 1008.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\"\n```\n\nThe pair of numbers 612.00 1008.00 represents the width and height of the paper in inches, multiplied by 72. Replace all three instances of these numbers with the dimensions of the paper you want to add. For example to add 11\"x17\" paper, replace the numbers with 792.00 1224.00.\n\nThe string \"Legal/US Legal\" identifies the paper. On the left side of the slash, Legal is a magic identifier that the filter uses to identify the paper size. Replace it with the one you want to use. Refer to the mediaSizeData array in optBase.h for a list of possible values. The string to the right of the slash can be set to any human-readable value.\n\nIf you want to enable borderless printing for a paper size, prefix the magic identifier string you just found with the letter T. So Letter would become TLetter. Additionally, change the four numbers 8.40 8.40 8.40 8.40 to 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00.\n\nFor example, I was able to add 11x17 paper to the PPD for a Workforce 7710 by adding the following lines:\n\n```\nCustomMedia \"USB/US B(11x17 in)\" 792.00 1224.00 8.40 8.40 8.40 8.40 \"<</PageSize[792.00 1224.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\" \"<</PageRegion[792.00 1224.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\"\nCustomMedia \"TUSB/US B(11x17 in) (Borderless)\" 792.00 1224.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 \"<</PageSize[792.00 1224.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\" \"<</PageRegion[792.00 1224.00]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice\"\n```\n\nOnce you have added your custom size, recompile your_ppd_filename.drv into a PPD file with ppdc (also from cups):\n\n```\n$ ppdc your_ppd_filename.drv\n```\n\nThis will create a ppd file in the ppd directory with a file name derived from the PCFileName parameter in your_ppd_filename.drv. You can test this file by uploading it to the CUPS web interface, or install it permanently by overwriting the original PPD file and making the package with makepkg.\n\n"

Please check the device and try again. This is likely due to the missing hplip-pluginAUR, but can be bypassed by disabling fax support on the printer itself.\n- As of hplip v3.24.4, hp-setup crashes when you manually supply a path to the PPD. See this bug report for a patch\n\nhplip provides drivers for HP DeskJet, OfficeJet, Photosmart, Business Inkjet, and some LaserJet printers, and also provides an easy to use setup tool. See https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index for the list of supported printers.\n\nhplip requires python-pyqt5 to run the GUI qt frontend. hp-setup requires CUPS to be installed and cups.service to be started to save the printer. hp-setup also requires the lsusb software, which is provided by the usbutils package.\n\nTo run the setup tool with the GUI qt frontend:\n\n```\n$ hp-setup -u\n```\n\nTo run the setup tool with the command line frontend:\n\n```\n$ hp-setup -i\n```\n\nTo set up directly the configuration of a network connected HP printer:\n\n```\n$ hp-setup -i ip_address\n```\n\nTo run systray spool manager:\n\n```\n$ hp-systray\n```\n\nTo generate a URI for a given ip address:\n\n```\n# hp-makeuri <ip address>\n```\n\nPPD files are in /usr/share/ppd/HP/.\n\nIf your printer is listed as requiring a binary plugin, install the hplip-pluginAUR package from AUR. If the binary plugin hplip-pluginAUR is a requirement you will need to start the cups.service before the PPD is recognized by hplip. If that does not work, reboot and log in with the printer off. Then switch it on and run a test print.\n\nNote: **Either:** \n\n- Either: Install hplip first, then retrieve the PPD file that matches your printer from /usr/share/ppd/HP/. Next, remove hplip entirely as well as any unnecessary dependencies. Finally, install the printer manually using the CUPS web UI, selecting the PPD file you retrieved, and then re-install hplip. After a reboot, you should have a fully working printer.\n- Or: Remove hplip, foomatic-db and foomatic-db-engine along with any unnecessary dependencies. Reinstall hplip and restart CUPS. Install your printer using the CUPS web UI, which should now be able to find the drivers automatically. No reboot needed.\n\n"

The bottom line of all this is that supporting Samsung products is at a flux.\n\nA major site for information about Samsung printers/scanners is Samsung Unified Linux Driver Repository.

Yet the actual drivers suggested are the closed source from Samsung (HP). samsung-unified-driver, on the other hand, also encompass Windows and Mac.

Note that samsung-unified-driver includes software that can stand on its own, not tied to cups. If you can not get the printer to work with cups, you might try this route.\n\nThat said, there are more options. An overview is at alternatives.\n\n- For Samsung Printer Language, there is splix. For a list of models that are supported, see its home page. Other SPL Samsung printers, even though not in that list, might work with splix.\n- QPDL (Quick Page Description Language) printers, some of which are supported by splix, are also supported by by foo2qpdl, provided by the #foo2zjs package.

Chances are that it will work with CUPS generic postscript printer, especially if it is only black & white and only printer, without a scanner added to it. Generic driver may be missing functionality or limited, for example in their support for duplex, color control, and resolution settings, and print quality may be lower.\n\n"
