      "content": "Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) for checking the integrity of files. It does this by creating a baseline database of files on an initial run, and then checks this database against the system on subsequent runs. File properties that can be checked against include inode, permissions, modification time, file contents, etc.\n\nAIDE only does file integrity checks. It does not check for rootkits or parse logfiles for suspicious activity, like some other HIDS (such as OSSEC) do. For these features, you can use an additional HIDS (see [1] for a possibly biased comparison), or use standalone rootkit scanners (rkhunter, chkrootkit) and log monitoring solutions (logwatch, logcheck).\n\n"

      "content": "To check your configuration, use aide -D.\n\nTo initialize the database, use aide -i or aideinit. Depending on your configuration and system, this command can take a while to complete.\n\nYou can check the system against the baseline database using aide -C, or update the baseline db using aide -u.\n\nFor more info, see aide(1).\n\n"
