Note that not all browsers support gopher, or have incomplete support.\n\n"

      "content": "Gopher is a plain text protocol. Begin by creating a gophermap that defines the homepage of your gopherhole and includes links to the rest of your content. A gophermap includes item types that describe the content in the file. An example might look like this:\n\n```\niWelcome to this Gopherhole!\n\n0This is a text file in a link\tfile.txt\n9This is a pdf file in a link\tfile.pdf\n1This is a link to a directory\tsubdir\n\nIAn image\timg.gif\n\n0A file on another server\t/gopher/relevance.txt\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\nhA HTTP link to a website URL:https://archlinux.org\n```\n\nThe format for the file is the item type as the very first character, the display string (i.e., the description text to display), a selector (i.e., a file-system pathname), host name (i.e., the domain name of the server on which the item resides), and port (i.e., the port number used by that server). The item type and display string are joined without a space; the other fields are separated by the tab character.\n\nA full list of the available item types can be found on Wikipedia:Gopher (protocol)#Item types.\n\n"
