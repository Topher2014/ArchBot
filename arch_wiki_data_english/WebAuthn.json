WebAuthn is a core component of the FIDO2 Project under the guidance of the FIDO Alliance. The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using public-key cryptography.\n\nSimilar to legacy U2F, Web Authentication is resilient to verifier impersonation, that is, it is resistant to active man-in-the-middle-attacks, but unlike U2F, WebAuthn does not require a traditional password. Moreover, a roaming hardware authenticator is resistant to malware since the private key material is at no time accessible to software running on the host machine. Passkey is another term used by some vendors to refer to WebAuthn or FIDO credentials.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "FIDO2 is the successor of the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor U2F legacy protocol. FIDO2 authentication has all the advantages of U2Fâ€”the primary difference is that a FIDO2 authenticator can also be a single-factor (passwordless) authenticator. The U2F protocol is designed to act as a second factor to strengthen existing username/password-based login flows.\n\n"

      "content": "WebAuthn/FIDO2 is supported by major sites like Google, Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub. See https://www.dongleauth.com/ to find other websites and links to setup documentation. Major sites offer different WebAuthn variants but may first offer Passkeys authentication, since that allows to transiently synchronize credentials to a cloud-based account instead of relying on a separate hardware authenticator or password manager.\n\nModern browsers like Firefox and Chromium support WebAuthn authentication standalone, additional dependencies are not required.\n\nFor a demo site to test the WebAuthn authentication process, see https://webauthn.io/.\n\n"
