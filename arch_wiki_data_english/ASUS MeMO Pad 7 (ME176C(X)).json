With Android 5.0 (Lollipop) it was updated with UEFI boot, which makes it possible to boot any Linux distribution on it. In general, Arch Linux works as-is, but there are additional (custom) packages available for full functionality.\n\n"

However, it is possible to keep only the boot partition on the internal storage and have the root partition on an external SD card for dual/multi boot.\n\n1. To boot from internal storage you need an UEFI boot loader. me176c-boot is a fork of systemd-boot with extra features for this tablet. See me176c-boot - Installation.\n1. There is not enough space on the EFI system partition to use it as a boot partition.

For convenience there are custom ISO provided in the archlinux-me176c releases. They do not differ from the default except that they run with linux-me176c and have all me176c packages installed. Look for the latest \"archiso\" release and download it, then follow USB flash installation media to flash it to your USB flash drive.\n\nConnect the USB keyboard and the USB flash drive to the USB hub, enable the external power supply and connect it to the tablet while it is powered off. Keep pressing F2 to enter the UEFI setup. There is no need to change anything. Navigate to the Save & Exit tab and use Boot Override to boot from the USB flash drive.\n\nInstallation instructions are provided in the Installation guide. A few device-specific recommendations and instructions are listed here.\n\n"
