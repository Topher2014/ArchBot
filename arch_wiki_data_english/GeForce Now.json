Simply install the extension, reload play.geforcenow.com. Now open Dev-Tools (F12) and find the database with the objcetstore. Here you can add a key for \"keyboardLayout\" with the proper value for your language. German example:\n\n```\n{\n   \"key\": \"keyboardLayout\",\n   \"value\": {\n     \"name\": \"Deutsch\",\n     \"code\": \"de-DE\"\n   }\n },\n```\n\nAfter saving, reload the page and you are done.\n\nAs an alternative, a user-proivded extension exists, with all the currently pre-defined layouts from the GFN page. Since this extension is not in the Chrome Webstore, you must sideload it as unpacked extension.\n\n"
