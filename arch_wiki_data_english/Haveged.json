Haveged was created to remedy low-entropy conditions in the Linux random device that can occur under some workloads, especially on headless servers.\n\n"

If it is rather low (<1000), you should probably install haveged. Otherwise cryptographic applications will block until there is enough entropy available, which eg. could result in slow wlan speed, if your server is a Software access point.\n\nYou should use this command again to verify how much haveged boosted your entropy pool after the installation.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "As discussed at Is it appropriate to use haveged as a source of entropy on virtual machines?, it can be contested whether haveged provides quality entropy within a virtual environment. Haveged relies on the rdtsc instruction, which may be virtualized within a virtual machine resulting in lower quantity entropy. On some hypervisors, it is possible to disable the virtualization of rdtsc, which would in theory allow haveged to provide higher quality entropy.\n\n"
