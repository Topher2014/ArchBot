To do use, enter the following:\n\n```\n# mysql -p -u root\n```\n\n```\nCREATE DATABASE amarokdb;\nUSE amarokdb;\nGRANT ALL ON amarokdb.* TO amarokuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nquit\n```\n\nThis creates a database called 'amarokdb' and a user with name 'amarokuser' with the password password who can access said database from localhost. If you want to connect to your database computer from a different computer, change the line to\n\n```\nGRANT ALL ON amarok.* TO amarokuser@'%' IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\n```\n\nTo configure Amarok to use MySQL, enter the Configure Amarok screen, choose Database and mark \"use external MySQL database\". Enter the server (usually \"localhost\" if on your local box, else the name of the remote box), the username (\"amarokuser\" in this example) and your chosen password-user. Do not forget to select the path to your music collection.\n\n"
