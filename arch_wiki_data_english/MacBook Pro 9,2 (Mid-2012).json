      "content": "synclient is included with the xf86-input-synaptics driver. It is useful for experimenting with settings as they take effect immediately and expire at the end of an X session. Many macOS options can be emulated without any additional software.\n\nRun synclient -l to have a look at all the available options. Here are some suggestions which resemble the options found in macOS's System Preferences:\n\n- By default synaptics is configured to use a double-tap drag gesture found on older touchpads - one may argue that this is not necessary on a clickpad. synclient TapAndDragGesture=0 will turn this off.\n- TapButtonX and ClickFingerX sets the mouse button triggered by tapping or clicking with X fingers. set TapButton2=3 and ClickFinger2=3 to assign two-finger click to the right mouse button.\n- Setting the bottom-right corner click to right mouse button can be done by subtracting about 500 from RightEdge and BottomEdge and plugging the new values into RightButtonAreaLeft and RightButtonAreaTop. If the last two options are not visible, set Clickpad=1.\n\nTo make settings permanent, just modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf.\n\n"
