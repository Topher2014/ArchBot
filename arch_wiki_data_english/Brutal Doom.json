      "content": "Brutal Doom is a gore-themed gameplay mod that was created in 2010 by Marcos Abenante (Sergeant_Mark_IV). It is compatible with Doom, The Ultimate Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth, Final Doom, and other custom WADs. Brutal Doom won the first ever Cacoward in 2011 for Best Gameplay Mod and a MOTY award for creativity by Mod DB in 2012.\n\nThe mod adds features many new graphical effects like additional blood (blood gets splattered on walls and ceilings if enemies or the player get hit), the ability to blow off body parts with strong weapons like the shotgun, new death animations, fake flares and 3D blood effects for OpenGL, and the addition of special illuminating effects on projectiles and pick ups. It is compatible with the source ports ZDoom, GZDoom, Skulltag, and Zandronum.\n\nWhile primarily a gore mod, it goes further and alters the gameplay by changing the weapons, monster AI, sounds, graphics, and combat. One such change is the increased difficulty, making enemy behavior much faster, unpredictable and dangerous (many attacks do double the normal damage to the player) and altering their attacks. It makes the animations smoother and gives the player new abilities. [1] [2]\n\n"
