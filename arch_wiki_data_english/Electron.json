For example, there is a website showing you the pressed buttons on the gamepad, and you want to create a separate window for that. Run:\n\n```\n$ nativefier --name gamepad-overlay \\\n--platform linux --arch x64 \\\n--width 1024 --height 768 \\\n--tray --disable-dev-tools \\\n--single-instance \"https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&s=4&smeter=1\"\n```\n\nNow in your home directory there will be a binary ~/gamepad-overlay-linux-x64/gamepad-overlay. You can run it and have the gamepad overlay in its own window.\n\nFor more options, see the project homepage.\n\n"
