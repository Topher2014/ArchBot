The selection of languages available in TeXstudio will match the hunspell dictionaries installed. If no dictionaries are installed, it is impossible to select a language in the application.\n\nYou can also install languagetool for a more advanced language check, or connect to a remote LanguageTool server. In any case, you need to install the hunspell dictionary for your desired language, otherwise TeXstudio will not let you select it, even if your LanguageTool installation or server supports it.\n\n"
