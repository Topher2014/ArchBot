Open it in a browser and sign in with your account credentials if needed. Follow the prompt on the browser, after which a success message will be printed on the console.\n\nJust like Tailscale, it is possible to use a setup key to add a node:\n\n```\n# netbird up --setup-key 2CA35F84-3D54-4997-884D-FE72864ACFD7\n```\n\n"

      "content": "One possible cause is conflict with Tailscale. By default, the Tailscale service will create firewall entries to filter traffic within the virtual network. All traffic originating from Tailscale's subnet must come from Tailscale's network interface. However, Tailscale and Netbird both use the same 100.64.0.0/10 subnet, thus Tailscale traffic will work fine, but Netbird traffic will be completely blocked.\n\nThis is the offending rule:\n\n```\n-A ts-input -s 100.64.0.0/10Â ! -i tailscale0 -j DROP\n```\n\nRemoving this rule on all affected nodes resolves the issue. However, this is not a permanent solution. Instead, disable the iptables rules entirely:\n\n```\n# tailscale up --netfilter-mode off\n```\n\nA better solution would be to use different subnets for Tailscale and Netbird, but at the moment they are not supported:\n\n- https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/183\n- https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/issues/446\n\n"
