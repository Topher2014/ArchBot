Going into the main tab in the BIOS menu, and pressing (Ctrl+S) should bring up the relevant options.\n\n"

You can verify this by inhibiting the handling of the power button\n\n```\n# systemd-inhibit --what=handle-power-key sleep 1h\n```\n\nand recording the events:\n\n```\n# stdbuf -o0 evemu-record /dev/input/event3 > event3\n```\n\nPressing the power button should log an event.\n\nThe other detected power button seems to be a virtual, firmware-handled button. This power button will be triggered when your device runs out of battery. The firmware will send many power button presses, so your machine will most likely only take a few seconds to power off because systemd kills the process/unit it is waiting for when the power button is pressed.\n\nHolding the physical shutdown button for more than three seconds will force the system to shutdown.\n\nSee logind.conf(5) for more information on handling specific keys.\n\n"
