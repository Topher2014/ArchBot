If early keyboard is needed, for example with password-based full disk encryption, some mkinitcpio configuration is necessary.\n\nThe following was used to get a reliably working keyboard in initramfs. It is unknown if all the items are necessary, but they at least appear to get the job done.\n\n```\n/etc/mkinitcpio.conf\n```\n\n```\n# For early (initramfs) keyboard\n# In the MODULES section\nMODULES=(amdgpu asus_wmi atkbd dm_crypt ext4 fat i2c_hid i8042 ohci_pci xhci_pci)\n# In the HOOKS section\nHOOKS=(base udev keyboard keymap sleep autodetect modconf block encrypt lvm2 filesystems fsck)\n```\n\n"
