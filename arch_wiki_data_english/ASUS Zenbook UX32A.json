      "content": "The installation should work with no problems and Wi-Fi should work out of the box. The UX32A ships in two versions: either with 500 GB HDD + 24 GB SSD or with 128 GB HDD and 128 GB SSD. Since 24 GB is more then enough for a full Arch Linux installation, it is recommended to install at least the non-home partitions onto the SSD.\n\n"
