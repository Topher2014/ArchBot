      "level": 2,
      "content": "By default, the cache directories will be created in /var/cache/squid, and the appropriate permissions set up for those directories. However, for greater control, we need to delve into /etc/squid/squid.conf.\n\nThe following options might be of some use to you. If you do not have the option present in your configuration file, add it!\n\n- http_port - Sets the port that Squid binds to on your local machine. You can have Squid bind to multiple ports by specifying multiple http_port lines. By default, Squid binds to port 3128.\n\n```\nhttp_port 3128\nhttp_port 3129\n```\n\n- http_access - This is an access control list for who is allowed to use the proxy. By default only localhost is allowed to access the proxy. For testing purposes, you may want to change the option http_access deny all to http_access allow all, which will allow anyone to connect to your proxy. If you wanted to just allow access to your subnet, you can do:\n\n```\nacl ip_acl src 192.168.1.0/24\nhttp_access allow ip_acl\nhttp_access deny all\n```\n\n- cache_mgr - This is the email address of the cache manager.\n\n```\ncache_mgr squid.admin@example.com\n```\n\n- shutdown_lifetime - Specifies how long Squid should wait when its service is asked to stop. If you are running squid on your desktop PC, you may want to set this to something short.\n\n```\nshutdown_lifetime 10 seconds\n```\n\n- cache_mem - This is how much memory you want Squid to use to keep objects in memory rather than writing them to disk. Squid's total memory usage will exceed this! By default this is 8MB, so you might want to increase it if you have lots of RAM available.\n\n```\ncache_mem 64 MB\n```\n\n- visible_hostname - hostname that will be shown in status/error messages\n\n```\nvisible_hostname cerberus\n```\n\n- cache_peer - If you want your Squid to go through another proxy server, rather than directly out to the Internet, you need to specify it here.\n- login - Use this option if the parent proxy requires authentication.\n- never_direct - Tells the cache to never go direct to the internet to retrieve a page. You will want this if you have set the option above.\n\n```\ncache_peer 10.1.1.100 parent 8080 0 no-query default login=user:password\nnever_direct allow all\n```\n\n- maximum_object_size - The largest size of a cached object. By default this is 4 MB, so if you have a lot of disk space you will want to increase the size of it to something reasonable.\n\n```\nmaximum_object_size 10 MB\n```\n\n- cache_dir - This is your cache directory, where all the cached files are stored. There are many options here, but the format should generally go like:\n\n```\ncache_dir <storage type> <directory> <size in MB> 16 256\n```\n\nSo, in the case of a school's internet proxy:\n\n```\ncache_dir diskd /cache0 200000 16 256\n```\n\nIf you change the cache directory from defaults, you must set the correct permissions on the cache directory before starting Squid, else it will not be able to create its cache directories and will fail to start.\n\n"

With the option enabled, Squid will append any domain configured in /etc/resolv.conf when making the request (e.g. mywebapp.company.local).\n\n```\ndns_defnames on\n```\n\n"
