Set XMODIFIERS:\n\n```\nexport XMODIFIERS=@im=gcin\n```\n\ngcin uses the name \"gcin\" by default and you can change this with the environment variable GCIN_XIM in order to run multiple gcin instances, for example:\n\n```\nexport GCIN_XIM=gcin_zh\nexport XMODIFIERS=@im=gcin_zh\n```\n\nRemember that gtk2 applications start one instance of gcin automatically if it does not exist.\n\n3. Start gcin:\n\n```\ngcin &\n```\n\n4. Run your applications! If gcin is killed when your applications are running, it is likely to cause crash or other problems.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "1. If you run wine or Crossover Office, it is better to use Windows 2000 emulation instead of Windows 98, and you have to start gcin and wine/cxoffice with at least LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.utf8, otherwise wine will not be able to show Chinese correctly.\n1. In wine+IE6 with Windows 98 emulation, LC_CTYPE is not enough if you want to input Chinese on the web-pages - you have to set either LANG or LC_ALL to zh_TW.utf8, which slows down wine a lot. However, you can always type Chinese in the location bar or other places and paste it.\n\n"
