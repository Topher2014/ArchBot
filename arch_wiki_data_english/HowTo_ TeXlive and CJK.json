You may also be interested in making Tex Live fonts available to Fontconfig (but this is not strictly necessary).\n\nUsers of poppler-based PDF viewers like Evince should install poppler-data as an additional dependency to properly display PDF documents containing CJK characters. (This appears unnecessary if CJK fonts from noto-fonts-cjk are used.)\n\nNeedless to say, your locale should have a character encoding that can deal with special characters (such as UTF-8) and you should also have an input method editor installed. The (Simplified/Traditional) Chinese, Japanese, and Korean subpages of Localization also contain information pertaining to locales and fonts.\n\n"
