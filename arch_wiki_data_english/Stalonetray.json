This can be accomplished with either the command-line argument --dockapp-mode simple or by modifying ~/.stalonetrayrc.\n\nOpenbox now treats the tray as the dock, and you can adjust its position by using the Openbox Configuration Tool. To run Stalonetray on start up, add the following to ~/.config/openbox/autostart:\n\n```\nstalonetray --dockapp-mode simple &\n```\n\nSee also Stalonetray WM hints for OpenBox\n\n"
