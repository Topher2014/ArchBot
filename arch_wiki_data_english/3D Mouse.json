      "content": "There is an open source driver for 3Dconnexion devices maintained by the spacenav project. From the short list of softwares that supports spacenavd we can cite:\n\n- Blender\n- Freecad\n- OpenSCAD\n\nFor it to work three things must be fulfilled:\n\n1. The device must be recognized by the kernel as input device\n1. The spacenavd daemon must be running\n1. The application must be compiled with spacenav support. (blender should be)\n\nThe first requirement should be fulfilled automatically after plugging in the device. It can be checked by looking if the device is listed in /proc/bus/input/devices:\n\n```\n$ grep 3Dconnexion /proc/bus/input/devices\n```\n\n```\nN: Name=\"3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator\"\n```\n\nFor the second point install libspnav and spacenavdAUR. For testing it is a good idea to start the daemon on foreground mode. The output should look similar to this:\n\n```\n# spacenavd -v -d\n```\n\n```\nSpacenav daemon 0.5\nDevice detection, parsing /proc/bus/input/devices\nusing device: /dev/input/event21\ndevice name: 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator\ntrying to open X11 display \":0\"\n   XAUTHORITY=/home/user/.Xauthority\n```\n\nIf it works you can simply shut down the daemon by hitting Ctrl+c and run it using the following service to start the daemon (should come with spacenavd).\n\n```\n/etc/systemd/system/spacenavd.service\n```\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Userspace Daemon of the spacenav driver.\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nPIDFile=/var/run/spnavd.pid\nEnvironment=XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority\nExecStart=/usr/bin/spacenavd\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nNow everything is up and running and every supported application should be able to use the 3D Mouse.\n\n"
