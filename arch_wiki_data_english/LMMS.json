See [1] for release notes.\n\nAs always, if you want to use multiple audio applications simultaneously but your hardware does not natively support this, you will need either a usermode sound server, or to configure ALSA dmix.\n\n"

For the audio driver, choose the sound server that you installed.\n\nStart the user service fluidsynth.service.\n\nWhen LMMS starts, it will prompt you with the settings. Go to the audio settings, choose the same interface that you set for FluidSynth, and restart LMMS if you made a switch.\n\n"
