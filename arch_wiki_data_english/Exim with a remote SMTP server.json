Many options in there are not necessary in a regular use case.\n\nConfiguration can be done in a single file containing several chapters. Exim’s configuration is divided into a number of different parts. General option settings must always appear before any other part. The other parts are all optional, and may appear in any order. Each part, other than the one for the general options, is introduced by the word “begin” followed by at least one literal space, and the name of the part. Other general comments about exim runtime configuration are given by this link to the official documentation.\n\nBelow is a very basic configuration, which provides: local delivers to system users, Mbox (also referred as traditional BSD mailbox) format, and authorized relaying to MX hosts. The description is based on a domain \"mydomain.tld\" served on a host \"hostname.mydomain.tld\". It is highly recommended to consult the official documentation before using the given documentation below.\n\n"

      "content": "Access Control Lists are at the heart of Exim. They are required for basic checks and may be used for sophisticated message processing. In general the overall message processing in Exim is:\n\n```\nconnection > (authentication >) ACL > routing > transport\n```\n\nWith this it is important to note that messages coming from authenticated clients are treated (by default) by the same ACL as messages coming from other mail servers. Exim know a full set of different ACL. Good knowledge of the SMTP protocol is required to choose the correct set of ACL.\n\n```\nacl_smtp_connect > acl_smtp_helo > ... > acl_smtp_rcpt > ... > acl_smtp_data > ...\n```\n\nFor a basic setup two ACL are mandatory: acl_smtp_rcpt and acl_smtp_data. These are default to deny while all other default to accept. The example below just prevents being an open relay. This setup has multiple security flaws (e.g. all authenticated users may use any mail address). If added to an existing configuration, it must be added before any other special section (i.e. before any existing \"begin\").\n\n```\n# use this ACL after SMTP RCPT TO: is received\nacl_smtp_rcpt = basic_acl_rcpt\n# use this ACL after SMTP DATA is finished, i.e. all data has been received\nacl_smtp_data = basic_acl_data\n\nbegin acl\n\n\tbasic_acl_rcpt:\n\t\t\n\t\t# accept all messages for which I am the receiving mail host\n\t\taccept \tdomains = +local_domains\n\n\t\t# accept all messages from authenticated clients\n\t\taccept\tauthenticated = *\n\t\t\n\t\t# deny all other messages (i.e. messages to be relayed from unauthorized\n\t\t# clients)\n\t\tdeny\tmessage = \"we are not an open relay\"\n\t\t\n\tbasic_acl_data:\n\n\t\t# we have done all checks after RCPT already\n\t\taccept\n```\n\n"

It is assumed that Dovecot & Exim are already setup and configured. Dovecot will serve as SASL authenticator and local transport mechanism. For this purpose the Dovecot services will be setup as follows.\n\n```\n/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf\n```\n\n```\nservice auth {\n\tunix_listener exim-auth {\n\t\tmode = 0600\n\t\tuser = exim\n\t\tgroup = exim        \n\t}\n\t# Auth process is run as this user.\n\tuser = $default_internal_user\n}\n\nservice lmtp {\n\t# a unix socket is preferred of a local port communication\n\tunix_listener exim-lmtp {\n\t\tmode = 0600\n\t\tgroup = exim\n\t\tuser = exim\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nTo use the Dovecot SASL in a TLS protected environment, add the following authenticator to Exim.\n\n```\n/etc/mail/exim.conf - authenticators section\n```\n\n```\nPLAIN:\n\t\tdriver = dovecot\n\t\tpublic_name = PLAIN\n\t\tserver_socket = /var/run/dovecot/exim-auth\n\t\tserver_set_id = $auth1\n\t\tserver_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_in_cipher}\n```\n\nThe existing router for local delivery can be reused. You may want to consider add a dsn_lasthop to the router definition. If DSN is used, Exim will assume final delivery of the message at this point. In the transport section the transport for local delivery must be replaced by the following transport definition.\n\n```\n/etc/mail/exim.conf - transports section\n```\n\n```\nlocal_delivery:\n\t\tdriver = lmtp\n\t\tsocket = /var/run/dovecot/exim-lmtp\n\t\tbatch_max = 200\n```\n\nNote: The host is specified in the router, not the transport. Thus, the router must look like:\n\n```\ndriver = smtp\nprotocol = lmtp\nport = 2525\n```\n\nThe host is specified in the router, not the transport. Thus, the router must look like:\n\n```\nlmtp_router:\n  driver = manualroute\n  domains = +local_domains\n  transport = local_delivery\n  route_list = * 127.0.0.1 byname\n```\n\nSince Dovecot is configured to provide a unix socket for the exim user, you may harden your security by adding the following line to the main configuration section.\n\n```\n/etc/mail/exim.conf - main section\n```\n\n```\n# don't deliver being root, drop privileges to exim user\ndeliver_drop_privilege = true\n```\n\n"

These are caused by the changing IP addresses in DNS queries for smtp.gmail.com. $host_address will expand to the particular IP address that was resolved by the gmail_route router.\n\nFor added security, use a per-application password.
