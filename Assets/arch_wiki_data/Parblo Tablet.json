      "content": "The Arch Linux must be able to recognize the tablet inputs with no problems, but the preset buttons should be in an odd configuration and should not be able to be modified. Some of them should be even with no functionality.\n\nWith the tablet connected, the first step must be identify your tablet using the command lsusb. The output should be something like\n\n```\nBus 001 Device 009: ID 0483:a640 STMicroelectronics Parblo A640 V2(F1)\n```\n\n(In this example we have a Parblo A640 V2 tablet. Make sure to match the output with your tablet.) It is important to grab the Vendor ID, which is found in the output in ID vendor:product, so in this example is 0483.\n\nAfter identifying the Vendor ID, you must find the most generic modalias that match with your tablet. To get this information, you should run in terminal the following command:\n\n```\n# find /sys -name *modalias | xargs grep -i vendor_id\n```\n\nThe output should display something like:\n\n```\n# find /sys -name *modalias | xargs grep -i 0483\n```\n\n```\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.0/0003:0483:A640.000C/input/input40/modalias:input:b0003v0483pA640e0100-e0,1,4,14,k71,72,73,74,75,77,79,7A,7B,7C,7D,7E,7F,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,8A,8C,8E,96,98,9E,9F,A1,A3,A4,A5,A6,AD,B0,B1,B2,B3,B4,B7,B8,B9,BA,BB,BC,BD,BE,BF,C0,C1,C2,F0,ram4,lsfw\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.0/0003:0483:A640.000C/input/input39/modalias:input:b0003v0483pA640e0100-e0,1,2,3,4,k110,111,112,113,114,14A,r0,1,6,8,B,C,a0,1,18,m4,lsfw\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.0/0003:0483:A640.000C/modalias:hid:b0003g0001v00000483p0000A640\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.0/modalias:usb:v0483pA640d0000dc00dsc00dp00ic03isc01ip03in00\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.1/0003:0483:A640.000D/input/input41/modalias:input:b0003v0483pA640e0100-e0,1,3,4,k140,14A,14B,14C,ra0,1,18,1A,1B,m4,lsfw\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.1/0003:0483:A640.000D/modalias:hid:b0003g0001v00000483p0000A640\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.1/modalias:usb:v0483pA640d0000dc00dsc00dp00ic03isc01ip02in01\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.2/0003:0483:A640.000E/modalias:hid:b0003g0001v00000483p0000A640\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.1/1-1.1.1:1.2/modalias:usb:v0483pA640d0000dc00dsc00dp00ic03isc00ip00in02\n```\n\nYou must find the most generic term that correspond to all of /input/input*/modalias:input: you found.

In this case we had a d0045 as an entry value.\n\nAfter identifying the modalias and the key values, you must create a hwdb rule.\n\nCreate a file called 10-parblo-tablet.hwdb in /etc/udev/hwdb.d with the following content, replacing [modalias] with your corresponding modalias and [value] with your corresponding key value:\n\n```\nevdev:input:[modalias]*\n KEYBOARD_KEY_[value]=332\n```\n\nYou can insert more KEYBOARD_KEY_X below, if you need.\n\nIn this example we are changing the key code to an arbitrary number 332 and it may not work with you. But you can check the full key code list in /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h.\n\n"
