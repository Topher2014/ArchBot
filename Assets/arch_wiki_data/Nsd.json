It may be useful to refer to the wiki page for unbound.\n\n"

      "title": "Initial setup",

      "content": "Most likely you will run nsd with a DNS caching servers such as Unbound. So, to avoid conflicts, this configuration use port 53530 for nsd, since port 53 is used by the DNS caching server. nsd will listen for requests on localhost. Additionally, the only firewall port that then needs to be open for dns queries coming from external machines (or other machines on the same local network) is port 53.\n\nWhen installed, a commented sample configuration file is placed at /etc/nsd/nsd.conf.sample. Below is a minimal working example:\n\n```\n/etc/nsd/nsd.conf\n```\n\n```\nserver:\n    server-count: 1\n    ip-address: 127.0.0.1\n    port: 53530\n    do-ip4: yes\n    hide-version: yes\n    identity: \"Home network authoritative DNS\"\n    zonesdir: \"//etc/nsd\"\nkey:\n    name: \"keyname\"\n    algorithm: hmac-md5\n    secret: \"secretkey\"\nzone:\n    name: \"example.com\"\n    zonefile: \"example.com.zone\"\n```\n\nSee [1] for more examples.\n\nNote that when running version 4.3.5 there will be a benign message in the status referring to \"unable to initgroups nsd: Operation not permitted\". This can be avoided by adding the following line to /etc/nsd/nsd.conf\n\n```\nusername: \"\"\n```\n\nand the unit status will no longer have the initgroups message.\n\n"

    {
      "title": "Configuring unbound",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Once this is working then if you are running unbound as the caching recursive server then you can switch the unbound configuration to forward queries from local machines on the same network to query nsd by using the following structure in unbound.conf (and see unbound), where it is assumed that nsd is listening to port 53530:\n\n```\ndo-not-query-localhost: no\nlocal-zone: \"example.com\" nodefault\ndomain-insecure: \"example.com\"\n```\n\n```\nstub-zone:\n       name: \"example.com\"\n       stub-addr: 127.0.0.1@53530\n```\n\nOnce the unbound.conf contains the above then restart unbound and check that local queries for the nsd zone entries works. Once it is all tested then you can switch unbound to listen on both 127.0.0.1 as well as on the external interface for the local network by having the lines in unbound.conf including:\n\n```\ninterface: 127.0.0.1\n   interface: 10.0.0.1\n```\n\nwhere 10.0.0.1 is the ip address of the dns server running both nsd and unbound and providing local dns for other machines on the 10.x.x.x network.\n\nThe examples here all assume that only ipv4 is being used. Corresponding configurations for ipv6 should be included where necessary, and further details on the parameters for that can be found in the man files for the two packages as well as examples that can be found with web searches.\n\n"

      "title": "WAN facing dns",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "It is also possible to change the configuration files and interfaces on which the server is listening so that dns queries from machines outside of the local network can access specific machines within the LAN. This is useful for web and mail servers which are accessible from anywhere, and the same techniques can be employed as has been achieved using bind for many years, in combination with appropriate port forwarding in the network firewall machines, to allow incoming requests to access the correct machine.\n\n"
