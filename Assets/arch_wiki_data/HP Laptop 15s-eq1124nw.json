One can manually add support for suspend-to-RAM by doing the following:\n\nFirst, get the iasl compiler by installing the acpica package.\n\nThen compile the following source using iasl <file>.asl:\n\n```\nDefinitionBlock (\"ssdt.aml\", \"SSDT\", 1, \"HACK  \", \"S3      \", 0x00000001)\n{\n\tScope (\\)\n\t{\n\t\tName (_S3, Package (0x04)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t0x03,\n\t\t\tZero,\n\t\t\tZero,\n\t\t\tZero\n\t\t})\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally, tell the kernel to use the new ACPI table.\n\n"
