      "content": "While fixed in firmware for the T14s models, the P16s (and P16v) still needs a workaround for an issue with the ath11k_pci module that occurs when resuming from either suspend or hibernation. Unloading the module prior to suspend/hibernate and loading it again on resume resolves the issue. You should also restart your network manager to avoid issues after resuming.\n\nPut this executable script at the path /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ath11k_pci, and adjust if you use a different network manager than systemd-networkd or NetworkManager:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nstart_nm() {\n\tsystemctl is-enabled NetworkManager.service && systemctl start NetworkManager.service\n}\n\nstart_systemd_networkd() {\n\tsystemctl is-enabled systemd-networkd.socket && systemctl start systemd-networkd.socket\n\tsystemctl is-enabled systemd-networkd.service && systemctl start systemd-networkd.service\n}\n\ncase $1 in\n\tpre) /usr/bin/systemctl stop NetworkManager.service systemd-networkd.service systemd-networkd.socket; /usr/bin/modprobe -r ath11k_pci ;;\n\tpost) start_nm; start_systemd_networkd; /usr/bin/modprobe ath11k_pci || exit 0 ;;\nesac\n```\n\n"
