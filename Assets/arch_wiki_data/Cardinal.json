It is DPF-based Rack wrapper that uses compiled-in modules and provides LV2/VST plugins plus a JACK app.\n\n"

All \"Core\" modules from Rack have been replaced by Cardinal equivalents, simplified to better work for an audio plugin. However the usage is very similar if not same. Left click and hold from jack to jack to make a connection using color from sequence, or right click to select specific color. For example you can follow Omhri Cohen's RBYG color coding. Control and click lets you connect more cables from the same jack (in other words stacking them up). You can follow up using many tutorials online. For example Red Means Recording's Intro to Eurorack (ft. VCV Rack) 2.5h long 4 part tutorial.\n\n"
