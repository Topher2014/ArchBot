      "content": "Because of the \"surround sound\" audio hardware on the UX390, you have to tweak a Pulse configuration file to get volume incrementing to work. Otherwise, the volume will either be full or muted, despite appearing to increment.\n\nEdit the analog output path config and add the Element Master and Element LFE parts below.\n\n```\n/usr/share/alsa-card-profile/mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common\n```\n\n```\n[Element Master]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = ignore\n\n[Element PCM]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = merge\noverride-map.1 = all\noverride-map.2 = all-left,all-right\n\n[Element LFE]\nswitch = mute\nvolume = ignore\n```\n\nThen, restart PulseAudio and changing the volume should work.\n\n"

      "content": "Since kernel version v5.8, the asus-wmi driver gained the ability to detect \"tablet mode\" on convertible devices. However, at least on UX390UAK the asus-wmi driver believes that the device is always in tablet mode, although it is not a convertible (see [1] for a kernel bug report). Libinput automatically disables touchpad and keyboard when kernel reports tablet mode, so they only work in tty but not in X or wayland.\n\nTo workaround this, add a quirk file for libinput:\n\n```\n/etc/libinput/local-override.quirk\n```\n\n```\n[test override 1]\nMatchUdevType=touchpad\nModelTabletModeNoSuspend=1\n\n[test override 2]\nMatchUdevType=keyboard\nModelTabletModeNoSuspend=1\n```\n\n"
