      "content": "On some machines, Bluetooth cannot turn on because of Fn+F3 switching only WLAN. Fixed DSDT table seems to solve the problem.\n\nOn the 3820TG, Bluetooth might not work even if Fn+F3 is used to turn it on. (Symptoms include \"usb disconnect\" messages in dmesg, and the adapter not showing up in hcitool dev.) In this case, copying /lib/firmware/ath3k-2.fw to /lib/firmware/ath3k-1.fw helps, see this mailing list thread. If it does not work for you, please change this note!\n\nFor some models of 4820TG, Bluetooth can be turned on with acer_wmi driver. To check that the driver is installed:\n\n```\nlsmod | grep acer_wmi\n```\n\nTo check bluetooth state (1 is on, 0 is off):\n\n```\ncat /sys/devices/platform/acer-wmi/rfkill/rfkill2/{name,state}\n```\n\n```\nacer-bluetooth\n0\n```\n\nTo turn on bluetooth:\n\n```\necho -n 1 > /sys/devices/platform/acer-wmi/rfkill/rfkill2/state\n```\n\n"
