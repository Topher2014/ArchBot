The installation live environment includes the Irssi client.\n\nYou are expected to familiarize yourself with our Code of conduct and General guidelines#IRC before joining any of the official channels. For a list of commonly used abbreviations, see Arch terminology.\n\n"

      "content": "In order to reduce spam, #archlinux and #archlinux-offtopic have the channel mode set to +r and +q $~a. This means you have to be identified via NickServ to be able to join these channels and send messages, respectively. If you are not registered and identified, you will be forwarded to #archlinux-unregistered.\n\nTo register with NickServ, follow the Libera Chat FAQ, as well as NickServ HELP when connected to irc.libera.chat:\n\n```\n/query NickServ HELP REGISTER\n/query NickServ HELP IDENTIFY\n```\n\nNote: **#libera** \n\n- If /query happens to not work in your client, you can try using either /quote NickServ command or /msg NickServ command.\n- Some IRC clients have a race-condition where they try to autojoin channels before you have been identified with NickServ. You need to enable SASL to solve this. Either look up your IRC client's documentation or look at the Libera Chat SASL page to find instructions for how to enable it.\n- You can get a list of people who can help you by typing /msg ChanServ FLAGS #archlinux, or join #libera and ask there.\n\n"

      "title": "Collaborative debugging",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "When requesting help from an IRC help channel (like #archlinux), it is inappropriate to paste logs into the channel and this may even get you kicked. Use a pastebin instead, you can use phriks factoid !paste to see which pastebins are acceptable. Acceptable pastebins usually work without enabling JavaScript. Some require enabling JavaScript for posting from a web browser, which is still acceptable because it does not affect the viewer. They should not display advertising or other disrupting content and should also not require a login. Excellent pastebins usually provide a way to paste output via piping.\n\nAn example list of acceptable pastebins:\n\n- https://0x0.st - supports pasting of almost any filetype. May have slightly broken MIME type detection.\n- https://paste.rs - supports pasting of images, but MIME type will be off.\n- https://bpa.st - good for people who want something graphical.\n- https://gist.github.com - useful if you want to also have rendered markdown or multiple files, supports CLI pasting via github-cli.\n\n"

It also helps to search for any error messages you are getting first to not waste anybodys time. It is also worth it to search for issues on any of the bugtrackers of the relevant software. The more helpful and verbose you are, the quicker you are going to receive help.\n\nIf this is a problem or question which is very specific to a specific software, consider visiting the dedicated IRC channel for it if there is one. It is more likely to receive a good answer there.\n\n"
