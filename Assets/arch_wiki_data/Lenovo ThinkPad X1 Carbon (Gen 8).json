BIOS updates (and possibly other firmware such as the Thunderbolt controller) can be queried for and installed through fwupd.\n\nLenovo may in the future provide cabinet files that can be directly installed with fwupdmgr. Check for Linux .cab files from the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 8) driver website.\n\n"

The Linux option is the traditional S3 power state where all hardware components are turned off except for the RAM, and it should work normally. The Windows option is a newer software-based \"modern standby\" which works on Linux (despite the name). One possible benefit to the Windows sleep state is faster wake up time, and one possible drawback is increased power usage.\n\n"
