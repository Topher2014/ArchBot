Video output in VLC may be cropped or otherwise malformed unless xorg-xwayland is installed.\n\nWith the following command VLC 3 will start using Wayland:\n\n```\n$ env -u DISPLAY vlc\n```\n\nThis works because VLC 3 checks for the environment variable DISPLAY on startup and will use Wayland if it is not set.
