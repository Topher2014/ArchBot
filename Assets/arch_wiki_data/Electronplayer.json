Because of this, running:\n\n```\n$ ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/electronplayer\n```\n\nand then running:\n\n```\n$ /usr/local/bin/electronplayer\n```\n\nwill NOT sandbox electronplayer, it will immediately break out of the sandbox and begin running unconfined as if it were not being run with firejail. A workaround I have found for this problem is as follows:\n\n"

First:\n\n```\n$ touch /usr/local/bin/electronplayer\n```\n\nthen:\n\n```\n$ chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/electronplayer\n```\n\nthen add the following text to /usr/local/bin/electronplayer, adding whatever arguments or options you like to either of the commands:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/bin/firejail /opt/electronplayer/electronplayer\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Now you can watch videos isolated from you normal web browser from the safety of the firejail sandbox!\n\n"
