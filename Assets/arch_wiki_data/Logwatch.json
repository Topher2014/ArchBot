      "content": "Logwatch has a tiered configuration approach. There are several locations where configuration details can be specified, with each one superseding the previous one:\n\n- /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/*\n- /etc/logwatch/conf/dist.conf/*\n- /etc/logwatch/conf/*\n- The script / command line arguments\n\nLogwatch will parse all these location when called.\n\nWithin these directories, there are several areas of configuration. The logwatch.conf files are where most of the high-level settings are, which allow you to set where your reports are sent, how they are formatted, etc. The configuration file at /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf contains all the default settings and comments on what they do. It is recommended to leave the default configuration alone and instead re-define a setting variable you want to change in /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf.\n\nWithin the logfiles directory of any locations are configuration files detailing specific log files. By default, most of the common log files found in a Linux system are already accounted for. If you have some esoteric application that does not have a log file configuration already, copy an existing one from the default.conf/logfiles directory and customize it for your application.\n\nThe services folder contains similar definitions, but these one define the various services reported by logwatch. This is necessary because often multiple services will report to the same log (e.g. messages, dmesg, boot, etc.). For more information, examine some of the default services files.\n\nNote that if you want logwatch messages delivered by email, you need to install a package that provides a sendmail frontend. Postfix is a good choice.\n\nThere is a helpful document supplied with the package to give further information on configuration. It is located at /usr/share/logwatch/HOWTO-Customize-LogWatch.\n\n"
