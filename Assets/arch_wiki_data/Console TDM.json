For convenience, you can just run tdmctl init.\n\nThe use of the program tdmctl is much like systemctl, and it is a powerful tool to configure Console TDM.\n\nYou can customize Console TDM by editing $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tdm/tdminit (sourced before the user is prompted for a session) and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tdm/tdmexit (sourced before the session is actually started).\n\n"
