OTR is a cryptographic protocol that will encrypt your instant messages.\n\nFirst you need to install pidgin-otr from the official repositories. Once this has been done, OTR has been added to Pidgin.\n\n1. To enable OTR, start Pidgin and go to Tools > Plugins or press Ctrl+u. Scroll down to the entry entitled \"Off-The-Record Messaging\". If the checkbox beside it is not checked, check it.\n1. Next, click on the plugin entry and select \"Configure plugin\" at the bottom. Select which account you wish to generate a key for, then click \"Generate\". You will have now generated a private key. If you are not sure what the other options do, leave them, the default options will work fine.\n1. The next step is to contact a buddy who also has OTR installed. In the chat window, a new icon should appear to the top right of your text input box. Click on it, and select \"Start private conversation\". This will start an 'Unverified' session. Unverified sessions are encrypted, but not verified - that is, you have started a private conversation with someone using your buddy's account who has OTR, but who might not be your buddy. The steps for verification of a buddy are beyond the scope of this section; however, they might be added in the future.\n\n"

Press it to enable or disable encryption. Also if you want to make encryption enabled by default right-click on a buddy's name (in your buddy list), and select Turn Auto-Encrypt On.
