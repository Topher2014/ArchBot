Unreal was created from the Dreamforge IRCd that was formerly used by the DALnet IRC Network. Over the years, many new and exciting features have been added to Unreal. It is hard to even see a resemblance between the current Unreal and Dreamforge.\n\n"

You can use Certbot to obtain a key and certificate, or generate a self-signed one as explained at Apache HTTP Server#TLS.\n\n"

Often errors are due to problems in your configuration.\n\n"
