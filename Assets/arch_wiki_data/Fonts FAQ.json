      "title": "Manual installation",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The recommended way of adding fonts that are not in the repositories of your system is described in #Creating a package. This gives pacman the ability to remove or update them at a later time.\n\nAlternatively, fonts can be installed manually:\n\n- For a single user, install fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts/. In many cases this suffices, unless you run graphical applications as other users. In the past ~/.fonts/ was used, but is now deprecated.\n- For system-wide (all users) installation, place your fonts under /usr/local/share/fonts/. You may need to create the directory first: mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts. /usr/share/fonts/ is under the purview of the package manager, and should not be modified manually.\n\n- In many cases this suffices, unless you run graphical applications as other users.\n- In the past ~/.fonts/ was used, but is now deprecated.\n\n- You may need to create the directory first: mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts.\n- /usr/share/fonts/ is under the purview of the package manager, and should not be modified manually.\n\nThe creation of a subdirectory structure is up to the user, and varies among Linux distributions. For clarity, it is good to keep each font in its own directory. Fontconfig will search its default paths recursively, ensuring nested files get picked up.\n\nAn example structure might be:\n\n```\n/usr/local/share/fonts/\n├── otf\n│   └── SourceCodeVariable\n│       ├── SourceCodeVariable-Italic.otf\n│       └── SourceCodeVariable-Roman.otf\n└── ttf\n    ├── AnonymousPro\n    │   ├── Anonymous-Pro-B.ttf\n    │   ├── Anonymous-Pro-I.ttf\n    │   └── Anonymous-Pro.ttf\n    └── CascadiaCode\n        ├── CascadiaCode-Bold.ttf\n        ├── CascadiaCode-Light.ttf\n        └── CascadiaCode-Regular.ttf\n```\n\nThe font files need to have sufficient read permissions for all users, i.e. at least chmod 444 for files, and 555 for directories.\n\nFor the Xserver to load fonts directly (as opposed to the use of a font server), the directory for your newly added font must be added with a FontPath entry. This entry is located in the Files section of your Xorg configuration file (e.g. /etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/xorg.conf). See #Older applications for more detail.\n\nFinally, update the Fontconfig cache (usually unnecessary as software using the Fontconfig library does this):\n\n```\n$ fc-cache\n```\n\n"

      "title": "Older applications",
      "level": 3,

Add or remove paths based on your particular font requirements.\n\n```\n# Let X.Org know about the custom font directories\nSection \"Files\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/100dpi\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/75dpi\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/cantarell\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/cyrillic\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/encodings\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/misc\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/truetype\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/TTF\"\n    FontPath    \"/usr/share/fonts/util\"\nEndSection\n```\n\n"

This example uses the ttf-liberation fonts to illustrate the solution (after successful installation of the package) and runs as root to enable them system-wide.\n\n```\n# fc-cache\n```\n\n```\n/usr/share/fonts: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 3 dirs\n/usr/share/fonts/TTF: caching, new cache contents: 16 fonts, 0 dirs\n/usr/share/fonts/encodings: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 1 dirs\n/usr/share/fonts/encodings/large: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs\n/usr/share/fonts/util: caching, new cache contents: 0 fonts, 0 dirs\n/var/cache/fontconfig: cleaning cache directory\nfc-cache: succeeded\n```\n\nYou can test for a default font being set like so:\n\n```\n$ fc-match\n```\n\n```\nLiberationMono-Regular.ttf: \"Liberation Mono\" \"Regular\"\n```\n\n"

The most common aliases are: serif for a font of the serif type (e.g. DejaVu Serif); sans-serif for a font of the sans-serif type (e.g. DejaVu Sans); and monospace for a monospaced font (e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono). However, the fonts which these aliases represent may vary and the relationship is often not shown in font management tools, such as those found in KDE Plasma and other desktop environments.\n\nTo reverse an alias and find which font it is representing, run:\n\n```\n$ fc-match monospace\n```\n\n```\nDejaVuSansMono.ttf: \"DejaVu Sans Mono\" \"Book\"\n```\n\nIn this case, DejaVuSansMono.ttf is the font represented by the monospace alias.\n\n"

That is to say, if one is looking at a window containing English and Chinese for example, it will switch to another font for the Chinese text if the default one does not support it.\n\nFontconfig lets every user configure the order they want via $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf. If you want a particular Chinese font to be selected after your favorite Serif font, your file would look like this:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\">\n<fontconfig>\n<alias>\n   <family>serif</family>\n   <prefer>\n     <family>Your favorite Latin Serif font name</family>\n     <family>Your Chinese font name</family>\n   </prefer>\n </alias>\n</fontconfig>\n```\n\n- If you use a Chinese locale, set LC_LANG to und to make this work. Otherwise both English and Chinese text will be rendered in the Chinese font.\n- If you want to see a list of fonts against ambiguous patterns (i.e. which might not match exactly) such as a generic family names, you can use fc-match --sort or fc-match --all.\n- fc-match --sort does not show a font if its Unicode coverage is provided by already shown font, see fc-match(1) and FcFontSort(3).\n- After changing the configuration run fc-match --all serif | head to verify your fallback font is set correctly.\n\nYou can add a section for sans-serif and monospace as well.\n\nFor more information, have a look at the Fontconfig manual. See also Font configuration#Set default or fallback fonts.\n\n"
