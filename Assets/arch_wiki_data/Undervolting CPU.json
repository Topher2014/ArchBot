Note that most desktop motherboards allow tweaking CPU voltage settings in BIOS as well.\n\nNote: **This article or section needs expansion.** This article or section needs expansion.\n\nThis article or section needs expansion.\n\n"

      "content": "Intel-undervolt is a tool based on this article for undervolting Haswell and newer Intel CPUs using MSR and MCHBAR registers. In addition, it also allows to change power and temperature limits. It is not compatible with Tiger Lake and above, but is compatible with intel_pstate.\n\n"

      "content": "The following command prints in use voltage settings:\n\n```\n# intel-undervolt read\n```\n\nNow edit the configuration file /etc/intel-undervolt.conf. Example configuration with undervolted CPU Cache by -100mV:\n\n```\n/etc/intel-undervolt.conf\n```\n\n```\n...\nundervolt 0 'CPU' 0\nundervolt 1 'GPU' 0\nundervolt 2 'CPU Cache' -100\nundervolt 3 'System Agent' 0\nundervolt 4 'Analog I/O' 0\n...\n```\n\nDecreasing CPU and CPU Cache by 100 to 200 mV is usually stable. Going above 200 mV may result in a crash, or may not have any effect at all.\n\nNote: **crucial** \n\nOnce you saved configuration file - test it:\n\n```\n# intel-undervolt apply\n```\n\nIt will print Success if settings were applied. You can double check in use configuration using the following command:\n\n```\n# intel-undervolt read\n```\n\nOnce you find stable configuration, you can also enable intel-undervolt.service to make changes persistent.\n\n"
