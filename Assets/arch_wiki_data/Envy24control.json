Envy24).\n\nenvy24control's user interface is loosely based on the Delta Control Panel software included with the purchase of M-Audio Delta series audio cards -- most of the tabs, controls, and capabilities are similar in the two applications. However, because they are two separate applications, the user manual for Delta Control Panel software is only marginally useful for envy24control users. This article aims to provide usage guidance for those using ice1712-based cards and envy24control with Arch Linux.\n\n"

      "content": "The Monitor Inputs page is effectively a mixer for your card's hardware inputs. It enables you to meter the \"post-gain\" incoming audio signals and adjust their volumes in the card's on-board \"monitor\" mixer. For each physical card input, there is a pair of volume faders, mute buttons, and pre-fader level meters. On the far left, there is a meter indicating the overall signal level being routed to the on-board mixer's \"pre out.\" The output of this digital mixer may be assigned to any of your card's hardware outputs on the Patchbay /Router page, by selecting \"Digital Mix L/R.\" (Typically, you would do this for the hardware outputs that your monitor speakers are connected to, e.g. \"H/W OUT 1/2.\")\n\n"

      "level": 4,
      "content": "Each mixer input channel has its own level meter that indicates the \"pre-fader\" levels of the incoming audio signal and are therefore not affected by the fader settings. Each input's meters are color-coded into three sections: green, orange, and red. The green section is a safe zone; most incoming audio signals should fill at least this section of the meter when recording. The orange section represents a hotter zone; it is both safe and recommended to adjust the incoming signal to meter mostly in this zone when recording. The red zone represents danger; when the signal hits 0dB, overload and audio clipping may occur. Adjust the output level of your audio source along with the appropriate \"ADC\" faders on the \"Analog Volume\" page so that the incoming audio levels do not peak in the red very often or for too long. Let your ears be the judge. See #Analog Volume.\n\n"

      "title": "Faders",
      "level": 4,
      "content": "The faders control the signal level in the card's digital mix. They do not control the level of the incoming audio signals -- they are \"post-meter.\" There is no gain control; the faders can only attenuate (reduce) the signal levels. A pair of faders can be \"ganged\", so that both channels can be controlled as a stereo pair. The mute buttons do exactly what you would expect: they mute the outgoing channel.\n\nA mono signal can be panned by setting the stereo faders or mute controls accordingly. For example, to pan hard left, mute the right channel. To pan soft right, set the right fader higher than the left. To preserve a stereo signal coming into 2 hardware inputs -- \"H/W In 1/2\", for example -- mute the right fader on \"H/W In 1\", and mute the left fader on \"H/W In 2.\"\n\nThe highest level setting on the faders is 0dB, or Unity Gain, which is an easy way of indicating a gain of factor 1 (equivalent to 0dB) where both input and output are at the same voltage level and impedance. Since there is no amplification available, clipping is impossible on the outgoing signal. If the incoming audio signal levels are ideal -- say, -12dB to -3dB (in the orange) -- it is perfectly safe to set the faders to 0dB (the highest level setting.)\n\nThe overall audio signal level of the on-board digital mixer's \"pre-out\" is indicated by the large meters on the far left, labeled \"Digital Mixer.\" This meter is visible on all pages in the application's UI and displays the same information regardless of which page is active.\n\n"

E.g., your outboard mixer, your mic pre-amp, etc.\n\n- The incoming audio signal levels and input meters are not affected by adjustments to the faders or mute buttons on the \"Monitor Inputs\" page.\n\n- The volume controls (faders and mute buttons) determine the audio signal level in the card's on-board digital mixer.\n\n"

      "content": "The Monitor PCMs page is effectively a monitor mixer for your card's software inputs. Software inputs are the digital audio streams sent by your software applications. Typically, on a Linux-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), this means JACK. The power of this functionality is most apparent when \"Digital Mix\" is connected to a pair of audio outputs in the Patchbay / Router tab, and you are mixing multiple sources from both hardware and software inputs See #Usage examples.\n\nThe faders, meters, and mute buttons operate identically to those on the Monitor Inputs page.\n\n"

      "content": "- The available software inputs are displayed as \"playback_X\", where X is a sequential number, in JACK's Connections dialog (in the \"Writable Clients / Input Ports\" box.) The number of available inputs will vary depending on your specific card.\n\n- \"PCM Out 1/2\" are typically used by applications like Ardour for their main outs. This is so common, the default signal routed to your card's physical outputs come from \"PCM Out 1/2.\" Therefore, when using your card for monitoring rather than Ardour's, use \"PCM Out 3\" or higher to monitor the signal you are actively recording to maintain mixing flexibility. See #Usage examples.\n\n- When connecting the \"capture_1/2\" output port to input ports in JACK's Connections dialog, be sure to mute the \"H/W In 1/2\" on the Monitor Inputs page. For example, if you use JACK to connect \"capture_1/2\" to \"playback_3/4\", not muting \"H/W In 1/2\" on the Monitor Inputs page will result in a combination of the direct input hardware signal with a software version of the same signal in the mixer (remember your card is a mixer!), and this usually produces signal phase problems or worse. Depending on the situation, you could even produce a signal loop.\n\n"

(In fact, the Delta Control Panel software that ships with M-Audio sound cards forces this behavior: there is no separate L and R channel on this page. The envy24control developers provided additional flexibility in this regard.)\n\n- Depending on your card, the number of \"playback_X\" channels available in JACK's Connections dialog will vary. Usually, the two highest-numbered channels are \"S/PDIF Out 1/2 (L/R).\" This may or may not be the case with your configuration; take a few minutes to experiment and make a note.\n\n- Learn to use the \"Digital Mix\" option. It is an extremely powerful feature that allows you to take some of the audio processing load off your recording software by handling the monitor mix with your card's hardware instead. This also provides the added benefit of near-zero latency while monitoring. See #Usage examples.\n\n- It should be fairly clear by now that the on-board mixer and patchbay / router in your sound card is highly versatile. You may want to re-read this page and make some practice adjustments to become proficient in routing and mixing with envy24control. If in the process you end up confused, you can set the card back to its default configuration by selecting the topmost option in all of the columns on the \"Patchbay / Router\" page.\n\n"

The \"S/PDIF Outs\" of the master clock card are connected to the \"S/PDIF Ins\" of the second card, and that card's clock is set to S/PDIF In, effectively \"chaining\" them together.\n\nWhen using an Int option, Int 44100 (44.1 kHz) and higher are recommended for digital recording.\n\n"

Until you adjust the ADC faders for the appropriate channels, the signal is effectively muted.\n\n- Setting the \"ADC\" faders to 127 (0dB) is the recommended starting value when adjusting incoming audio signal levels. This way, clipping is impossible in the card's digital mixer, and you only need to use your audio source's output level controls for adjustments.\n\n- If your audio source's maximum output levels are too low and do not meter in the orange on the \"Monitor Inputs\" page when the ADC fader is set to 127, slide the ADC fader up in small increments to amplify the signal until the desired levels are reached.\n\n- The numbering of the faders is zero-based.
