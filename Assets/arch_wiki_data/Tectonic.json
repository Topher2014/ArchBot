An advantage of Tectonic is that it, unlike traditional TeX tools, avoids cluttering the working directory with unnecessary files while compiling the document.\n\nHowever, the XeTeX engine, that Tectonic is based on, is not maintained and may have compatibility problems and missing features compared to other engines like pdfTeX or LuaTeX (both available through a standard TeX Live installation).\n\n"
