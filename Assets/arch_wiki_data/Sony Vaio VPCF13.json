The GPU issues (related to PowerMizer flags) can lead to diminished 3D application returns.\n\n```\nThis addition was used with 340.96 drivers with a 310M.\nThe original solution was sourced from: https://code.google.com/p/vaio-f11-linux/wiki/NVIDIASetup. Relevant to F11 series, but is valid with F13 series as well.\n```\n\nFor those using Nvidia drivers (possibly specifically 340.xx), add this line to the \"Device\" section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf:\n\n```\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n```\n\nIf the above mentioned addition does not work, the original line added in the \"Device\" section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf is:\n\n```\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1;PowerMizerEnable=0x1;PerfLevelSrc=0x3333;PowerMizerLevel=0x3;PowerMizerDefault=0x3;PowerMizerDefaultAC=0x3\"\n```\n\nIt is recommended to attempt adding one flag, testing to see if control is gained, then if not, adding another, to avoid possible unnecessary graphical collisions.\n\nPreviously mentioned additions/packages that may be useful, but are not up-to-date/irrelevant anymore:\n\n```\nsony_laptop module addition: MODULES=(sony_laptop) in /etc/rc.conf\n```\n\n"
