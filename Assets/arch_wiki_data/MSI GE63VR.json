      "content": "By default, ALSA reports Headphone and Speaker channels separately. However, on this laptop, the Speaker channel actually controls both the speakers and the plugged-in headphones, while the Headphone channel does not control anything. This is a problem because PulseAudio automatically sets the Speaker channel to zero when headphones are plugged in, which causes all outputs to be muted in this case.\n\nThe proposed fix is to disable the auto-mute feature (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=237456). Edit the file /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output-headphones.conf and replace the section\n\n```\n[Element Speaker]\nswitch = off\nvolume = off\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\n[Element Speaker]\nswitch = off\nvolume = merge\n```\n\nNote : This change may get overwritten when PulseAudio is updated.\n\n"

      "content": "The system will hang if you try to start the X server while the NVidia GPU is turned off via bbswitch. To fix it, add acpi_osi=! acpi_osi=\"Windows 2009\" to your kernel parameters. Beware of the quotes \" : for instance, if you use rEFInd as you bootloader, you will have to escape the quotes as \"\" since rEFInd already uses quotes in its configuration file.\n\nAfter applying this fix, power switching in optimus-manager should work with the following minimal config (as of version 1.3.1):\n\n```\n[optimus]\nswitching=bbswitch\npci_power_control=no\n```\n\nTo use the HDMI or DisplayPort port the Nvidia GPU must be powered on. You need to either run your whole X session on the Nvidia GPU, or run it on the Intel GPU and have the Nvidia card act as a display sink\n\n"

As an alternative, the tool msi-perkeyrgbAUR provides partial control, specifically for MSI laptops with per-key RGB. Tools designed for models with region-based RGB, such as MSIKLM, will not work.\n\nSince the RGB settings are stored into the keyboard itself, another option for dual-boot owners is to configure the keyboard once in Windows, and then reboot into Linux.\n\n"
