To list all interfaces available to vnstat, use vnstat --iflist.\n\nTo start monitoring a particular interface that was not referred to in the configuration file when the daemon was started, you must initialize a database first. Each interface needs its own database. The command to initialize one for the eth0 interface is:\n\n```\n# vnstat --add -i eth0\n```\n\nRemember to restart the vnstat.service daemon after you have added a new interface.\n\n"
