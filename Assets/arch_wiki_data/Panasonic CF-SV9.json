      "title": "Circular scrolling",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The device has a relatively small round-shape touchpad, so the ability to configure circular scrolling is important for usability (since the touchpad area is too small for gestures). As of 06/27/2020, libinput does not have support for circular scrolling, which means you cannot get circular scrolling in Wayland. Under Xorg, with xf86-input-synaptics installed, circular scrolling works fine with the following configuration section\n\n```\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf\n```\n\n```\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n        Driver \"synaptics\"\n        MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n        MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n        Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n        Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n        Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n        Option \"CircularScrolling\" \"on\"\n        Option \"CircScrollTrigger\" \"0\"\n        Option \"CircularPad\" \"on\"\n        Option \"LeftEdge\" \"80\"\n        Option \"RightEdge\" \"450\"\n        Option \"TopEdge\" \"80\"\n        Option \"BottomEdge\" \"450\"\nEndSection\n```\n\nNote: On the Panasonic Let's Note Model CF-SV7 If you found that you cannot move the cursor with the above, but can click you can try commenting out the LeftEdge, RightEdge, TopEdge and Bottom sections. It seems the touchpad on the SV7 differs slighty enough the defintions listed above make the entire circular touch pad a scroll wheel. I was able to scroll using the center of the pad.\n\nAfter saving the file, restart Xorg.\n\n"
