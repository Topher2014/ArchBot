However, it is not brightness problem, but keyboard buttons' problem. To control brightness while loaded from scratch, you can do the following command:\n\n```\n# cat 4882 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n```\n\nThis will change brightness value to 4882. It is maximum brightness level. You can choose some other value, of course.\n\n"
