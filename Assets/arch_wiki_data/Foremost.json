This process is commonly referred to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.\n\n"

Nevertheless, one could add additional file headers for detection, e.g. adding entries or uncomment examples:\n\n```\n/etc/foremost.conf\n```\n\n```\n#\twma     y       8000000  \\x30\\x26\\xB2\\x75    \\x00\\x00\\x00\\xFF\n#\n#\twma     y       8000000  \\x30\\x26\\xB2\\x75    \\x52\\x9A\\x12\\x46\n#\n\tmp3     y    \t8000000 \\xFF\\xFB??\\x44\\x00\\x00\n\tmp3     y    \t8000000 \\x57\\x41\\x56\\45            \\x00\\x00\\xFF\\\n\tmp3     y    \t8000000 \\xFF\\xFB\\xD0\\            \\xD1\\x35\\x51\\xCC\\\n\tmp3     y    \t8000000 \\x49\\x44\\x33\\\n\tmp3     y    \t8000000 \\x4C\\x41\\x4D\\x45\\\n```\n\n"
