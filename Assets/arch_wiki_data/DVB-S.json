You can choose which modules you want to build by executing:\n\n```\n$ make config\n```\n\nwhich will create a configuration file: v4l/.config.\n\nAfter that, you have to build the chosen modules:\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\nIf all configured modules were compiled successfully, you can install the modules at the kernel's default modules directory by executing:\n\n```\n# make install\n```\n\nAfter that, reboot your machine.\n\n"
