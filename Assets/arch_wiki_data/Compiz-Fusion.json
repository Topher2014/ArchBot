Important plugins are listed below:\n\n- Window Decoration - provides window borders, see #Window decoration.\n- Move Window.\n- Resize Window.\n- Place Windows - configure window placement options.\n- Application Switcher - provides an Alt+Tab switcher - there are numerous alternative application switcher plugins, for example: Shift Switcher, Static Application Switcher and more. Not all of them use the Alt+Tab keybinding.\n\nTo be able to switch to different viewports you will need to enable one of the following:\n\n- Desktop Cube & Rotate Cube - provides the spinning cube with each side being a different viewport.\n- Desktop Wall - viewports are arranged next to each other - the animation is similar to the workspace switching animation in Cinnamon and GNOME Shell.\n- Expo - creates a view of all viewports and windows when the mouse is moved into the top left corner - this plugin can be used on its own or in conjunction with either of the two previous plugins.\n\n"

      "content": "The window decorator is the program which provides windows with borders. Unlike window managers such as Kwin or Xfwm which provide just one decorator, users of Compiz have a choice of three: GTK Window Decorator, KDE Window Decorator and Emerald. The GTK Window Decorator and the KDE Window Decorator are included in the Compiz source and can be optionally compiled whilst building Compiz. Emerald, on the other hand, is a separate, standalone decorator. The Window Decoration plugin in CCSM must be ticked otherwise no window decorator will be started.\n\nThe window decorator that will be started is specified under CCSM -> Effects -> Window Decoration -> Command. The default command is compiz-decorator which is a script which will attempt to locate the emerald and gtk-window-decorator executables (and also the kde4-window-decorator executable if you are using Compiz 0.9). It will then start the first decorator that it finds, according to the search order and conditions (such as session detection) specified in the script. Note that the script provided by Compiz 0.8 differs significantly from the one provided by Compiz 0.9 so the behavior may be different.\n\nThe compiz-decorator command can be replaced with one of the executables listed above. If you find that your preferred decorator is not being started, try appending the --replace switch to the command, for example: emerald --replace.\n\n"

In CCSM, navigate to Application Switcher or Static Application Switcher depending on which plugin you are using. For the former, the Background settings are located under General and for the latter the settings are located under Appearance. Once you have found the settings, ensure that the Set background color box is ticked.
