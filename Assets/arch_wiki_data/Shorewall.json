Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the help of the iptables utility, Shorewall configures Netfilter to match your requirements.\n\nShorewall can be used on a dedicated firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server or on a standalone GNU/Linux system. Shorewall does not use Netfilter's ipchains compatibility mode and can thus take advantage of Netfilter's connection state tracking capabilities.\n\n"
