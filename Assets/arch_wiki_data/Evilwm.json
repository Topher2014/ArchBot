It is minimalist in that it omits unnecessary stuff like window decorations and icons. But it is very usable in that it provides good keyboard control with repositioning and maximize toggles, solid window drags, snap-to-border support, and virtual desktops. Its installed binary size is only 0.07 MB.\n\n"

An example of the use of switches to change this would be a ~/.xinitrc file such as:\n\n```\nexec evilwm -snap 10 -bw 2 -fg red\n```\n\nThis would enable\n\n- snapping to a border within 10 pixels,\n- a border width of 2 pixels,\n- red for the currently active window border.\n\nFrom evilwm(1) § OPTIONS:\n\n"
