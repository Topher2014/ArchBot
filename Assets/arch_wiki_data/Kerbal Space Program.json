Try using your settings.cfg file to enable fullscreen and/or change your resolution by a few pixels, e.g. 1366x768 to 1363x768.\n\nImperfect resolutions can cause poor font rendering. If this happens you can use the AnyRes mod to change your resolution in-game to find a good one, rather than launching the game for every change.\n\nAnother solution that may work on some architectures is to add -force-glcore as a launch option, or to pass it in as a command line flag. For Steam: go to Library, right click on KSP, Properties, Set up launch options, and add -force-glcore. The game engine will try to run the game with the best OpenGL version possible and all available OpenGL extensions. With this option enabled you may encounter shadow glitches, try few different settings in-game in the setting panel to resolve the problem.\n\n"

With some configuration the latter one comes pretty close to the vanilla behavior and even grants some additional features.\n\n"
