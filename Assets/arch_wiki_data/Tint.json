Its look is configurable and it only has few dependencies, making it ideal for window managers like Openbox, that do not come with a panel.\n\n"

      "content": "Since version 0.12, you have the ability to create launchers. Unfortunately, tint2 does not support nested menus yet, so there is no native function to enable an applications menu. This section describes a way to create a launcher for Openbox.\n\nBesides tint2 and Openbox, install the xdotool package. Next, create a keybinding for opening the Openbox menu:\n\n```\n~/.config/openbox/rc.xml\n```\n\n```\n<keyboard>\n <!-- Keybinding for opening OpenBox menu -->\n <keybind key=\"C-A-space\">\n   <action name=\"ShowMenu\"><menu>root-menu</menu></action>\n </keybind>\n</keyboard>\n```\n\nThis will set Ctrl+Alt+Space to open the root-menu (this is the menu that opens when you right-click the desktop). You can change root-menu to any menu-id that you have defined in ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml. Next we need to make that keybinding into a .desktop file with xdotool. First test that your keybind works with:\n\n```\n$ xdotool key ctrl+alt+space\n```\n\nIf the menu you chose pops up under your mouse cursor, you have done it right! Now create a open-openbox-menu.desktop file inside the ~/.local/share/applications directory. Add the line Exec=xdotool key ctrl+alt+space where Ctrl+Alt+Space are your chosen key combinations. Open your new open-openbox-menu.desktop file from your file manager and, once again, you should see the menu appear under your cursor. Now just add this to tint2 as a launcher, and you have your Openbox Applications Menu as a launcher for tint2. If you need to place the menu at a fixed position, you can use xdotool mousemove x y. You can create a script and reference it in open-openbox-menu.desktop since it involves two commands.\n\nSee Openbox Menus for further help on creating your own menu to use here, and menumaker to generate a nice full menu.xml for most (possibly all) of your installed programs.\n\nSince version 0.14, you have the ability to create buttons. Just add \"xdotool key ctrl+alt+space\" string from example above to button key action you want to be start menu action.\n\n"
