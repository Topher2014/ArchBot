      "content": "RethinkDB is a document-oriented database similar to MongoDB but aims to overcome scalability and practical limitation of the latter. [1] [2] RethinkDB is built to store JSON documents, and scale to multiple machines with very little effort. It has a pleasant query language that supports queries such as table joins and group by. It is easy to setup and learn. For more detailed information, see the official homepage.\n\n"

      "content": "Install rethinkdbAUR from the official repositories.\n\nCreate and set user rights for RethinkDB folder:\n\n```\n# mkdir /var/lib/rethinkdb/default\n# chown -R rethinkdb:rethinkdb /var/lib/rethinkdb/\n```\n\nNow you can start rethinkdb from the command-line:\n\n```\n# rethinkdb\n```\n\nAlternatively, start and enable rethinkdb@default.\n\nRethinkDB's admin UI is now available on port 8080.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "RethinkDB has multi-instance support, which means you can run several independent database instances on the same machine. The systemd service also supports multi-instance configuration.\n\nTo create a new RethinkDB instance, create its configuration file:\n\n```\n# cd /etc/rethinkdb\n# cp instances.d/default.conf instances.d/Name.conf\n```\n\nwhere Name represents the configuration you will be using later. Change the configuration options in the new file. Then start/enable rethinkdb@Name.service.\n\nThe 'default' instance is created at installation time for your convenience. Its data is stored in /var/lib/rethinkdb/default.\n\n"
