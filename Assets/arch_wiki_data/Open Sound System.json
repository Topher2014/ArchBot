OSS version 3 was the original sound system for Linux, but was superseded by the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in 2002 when OSS version 4 became proprietary software. OSSv4 became free software again in 2007 when 4Front Technologies released its source code and provided it under the GPL license.\n\n"

      "content": "Install the ossAUR package or the package with non-free drivers oss-nonfreeAUR. There is also a development version of OSS available with the oss-gitAUR package.\n\nThis will install the OSS, run the OSS install script (temporarily disabling the ALSA modules) and install the OSS kernel modules. Since ALSA is enabled by default, you need to disable it so it does not conflict with OSS. You can do this by blacklisting the soundcore module.\n\nAfter blacklisting the module, you can enable oss.service to start at boot.\n\nTo start using OSS without needing to reboot, check if any ALSA modules are still loaded (ALSA modules start with \"snd\"):\n\n```\n# lsmod | grep snd\n```\n\nRemove the ALSA modules as follows:\n\n```\n# lsmod | awk ' { print $1 } ' | grep snd | xargs rmmod\n```\n\nThen restart OSS:\n\n```\n# soundoff && soundon\n```\n\nTo completely remove ALSA from your system, you can compile a custom kernel and disable ALSA in its configuration. See Gentoo:ALSA#Kernel for the details.\n\nNote: **This article or section is out of date.** This article or section is out of date.\n\nThis article or section is out of date.\n\nIn case you are not part of the audio group, add yourself and relogin for the changes to take effect:\n\n```\n# gpasswd -a $USER audio\n```\n\nIn case OSS is not able to detect your card when starting it, run:\n\n```\n# ossdetect -v\n# soundoff && soundon\n```\n\n"

If there is no audio, try to adjust the volume or refer to the #Troubleshooting section.\n\nIf you want to hear sounds from more than one application simultaneously, you need vmix, OSS's software mixer.\n\nCheck that vmix is enabled by running:\n\n```\n$ ossmix -a | grep -i vmix\n```\n\nYou should see a line like vmix0-enable ON|OFF (currently ON). If you do not see any lines beginning with vmix, it probably means that vmix has not been attached to your sound device. To attach vmix, issue the command:\n\n```\n$ vmixctl attach device\n```\n\nwhere device is your sound device, e.g. /dev/oss/oss_envy240/pcm0.\n\nTo avoid having to issue this command manually in the future, you can add it to /usr/lib/oss/soundon.user, as suggested by the official documentation.\n\nIf you get a \"Device or resource busy\" error, you need to add vmix_no_autoattach=1 to /usr/lib/oss/conf/osscore.conf and then reboot.\n\nSee which devices are detected by running:\n\n```\n$ ossinfo\n```\n\nYou should be able to see your devices listed under Device Objects or Audio Devices.

Before you follow any of these steps, ensure you are going through a receiver/amplifier and using quality speakers and not simply computer speakers. If you are only using computer speakers, do not bother changing anything here as you will not notice a difference.\n\nBy default the sample rate is 48000hz. There are several conditions in which you may want to change this. This all depends on your usage patterns. You want the sample rate you are using to match the media you use the most. If your computer has to change the sampling rate of the media to suit the hardware it is likely, though not guaranteed, that you will have a loss in audio quality. This is most noticeable in down sampling (ie. 96000hz → 48000hz). There is an article about this issue in Stereophile which was discussed on Apple's CoreAudio API mailing list if you wish to learn more about this issue.\n\nNote: **This article or section is out of date.** This article or section is out of date.\n\nThis article or section is out of date.\n\nSome example sample rates:\n\nTo check what your sample rate is currently set to, run:\n\n```\n$ ossmix | grep rate\n```\n\nYou are likely to see vmix0-rate <decimal value> (currently 48000) (Read-only).\n\nNote: **This article or section is out of date.** This article or section is out of date.\n\nThis article or section is out of date.\n\nIf you do not see a vmix0-rate (or vmix1-rate, etc.) being outputted, then it probably means that vmix is disabled. In that case, OSS will use the rate requested by the program which uses the device, so this section does not apply. Exception to this are Envy24 (and Envy24HT) cards that have a special setting envy24.rate which has a similar function (see the oss_envy24 manpage).\n\nTo change your sample rate:\n\n1. First, make sure your card is able to use the new rate. Run ossinfo -v2 and see if the wanted rate is in the Native sample rates output.\n1. As root, run /usr/lib/oss/scripts/killprocs.sh. Be aware, this will close any program that currently has an open sound channel.\n1. After all programs occupying vmix are terminated, run as root: vmixctl rate /dev/dsp 96000 replacing the rate with your desired sample rate (and ossmix envy24.rate 96000 if applicable).\n1. Run ossmix | grep rate and check for vmix0-rate <decimal value> (currently 96000) (Read-only) to see if you were successful.\n1. To make the changes permanent add the following to the soundon.user file:\n\n```\n/usr/lib/oss/soundon.user\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nvmixctl rate /dev/dsp 96000\n# ossmix envy24.rate 96000 # uncomment if you have an Envy24(HT) card\n\nexit 0\n```\n\nand make it executable.\n\n"

It does not matter if it is PCH_C.\n\nThe last line of code is a bit complicated. This example is an ALC1150 sound card chip. The \"Vendor_id\" of \"ALC1150\" is \"0x10ec0900\", you can get it through a search engine, or try the following:\n\n```\n# cat /sys/class/sound/card0/device/hdaudioC0D0/vendor_id\n```\n\n```\n0x10ec0900\n```\n\n```\n# cat /sys/class/sound/card0/device/sound/card0/hwC0D0/vendor_id\n```\n\n```\n0x10ec0900\n```\n\nFor sound card chips of different manufacturers, different paragraphs need to be modified. In the example, the paragraph of Realtek manufacturer:\n\n```\noss-v4.2-build2020-src-gpl/kernel/drv/oss_hdaudio/hdaudio_codecids.h\n```\n\n```\n{0x10ec0889, \"ALC889\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n  {0x10ec0900, \"ALC1150\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n  {0x10ec0899, \"ALC899\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap},\n```\n\nIt is very important that on the hardware of this example, modifying the second-to-last line works, but modifying the same code on the first-to-last line fails. You will need to try and modify the same code over and over on different lines to work on your hardware.\n\nFor example, try on the 4th last line:\n\n```\n{0x10ec0887, \"ALC887\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n {0x10ec0900, \"ALC1150\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n {0x10ec0889, \"ALC889\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n {0x10ec0892, \"ALC892\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap}, \n {0x10ec0899, \"ALC899\", VF_ALC88X_HACK, (char **) &alc883remap},\n```\n\n- Dependency packages required for compiling OSS do not need to be installed one by one, the base-devel meta package provides the tools for creating packages.\n- You also need to install the toolkit for building kernel modules, which are built during the install phase.\n\n"
