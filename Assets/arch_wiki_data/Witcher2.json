To get it working again, simlpy skip the launcher as described in #Launcher unable to load page.\n\nThis is a strange corner case which happens infrequently at best (and the prerequisites for reproducing it are unknown), but the crash would look like this:\n\n1. Immediate segfault on start, before any windows get created\n1. The game creates ~/.local/share/aspyr-media/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/AppOptions.txt\n1.

Edit ~/.local/share/aspyr-media/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/AppOptions.txt and change the line reading EnableBugCollection 1 to EnableBugCollection 0.\n\nPresumably this fix will prevent any automated bug reports from reaching Aspyr, should you encounter crashes/bugs in the future, but it will at least let the game launch properly.\n\nIf the game crashed with:\n\n```\n./GameGuide/Civ6: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so.1: undefined symbol: FT_Done_MM_Var\n```\n\nThe solution is to set launch options to:\n\n```\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6 %command%\n```\n\nThe solution is to disable mods.\n\nThis may be caused by amdgpu driver crash due to insuffcient video memory. If running an integrated graphics (eg. AMD Renoir), try allocating more memory in your BIOS.\n\nWayland does not define a primary monitor, so the game will show the available resolutions of an arbitrary monitor; it may not have the same size and the mouse may be off. A solution is to set an Xwayland monitor as primary.\n\nTo find the list of Xwayland monitors: xrandr --listmonitors\n\nTo set (eg) the XWAYLAND4 monitor as the primary: xrandr --output XWAYLAND4 --primary\n\nIf the launcher window is huge (sometimes bigger than the screen), then the scaling is wrong. Add QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0 to the launch options and on next start the launcher should be usable.\n\nThe launcher often shows errors like Error loading page. It is possible to bypass the launcher by editing the games startup configuration ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Civ6 and changing the line ./GameGuide/Civ6 to ./Civ6Sub.\n\n"

Similarly, if you use PipeWire, start the game with SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulseaudio - other backends might also work, but the default one does not.\n\nDue to changes in how linking works, the game might not properly load its bundled dependencies. To fix this, you can either run the game with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"GAME/lib/x86_64/\" or symlink the libraries from GAME/lib/x86_64/* to GAME/lib/*.[14]\n\nThe game may also segfault if you use an AMD Zen 3 or newer CPU. To fix this you can hack together a small shared library to replace the mprotect function and make sure the allocated memory has the PROT_READ access flag.[15]. Here is an example:\n\n```\n$ cat game.c\n#include <sys/mman.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <sys/syscall.h>\n\nint mprotect(void *addr, size_t len, int prot) {\n  if (prot == PROT_EXEC) {\n    prot |= PROT_READ;\n  }\n  return syscall(__NR_mprotect, addr, len, prot);\n}\n```\n\nYou can then compile the library and move the shared object to the game libraries:\n\n```\n$ gcc game.c -shared -o game.so\n$ mv game.so GAME/lib/\n```\n\nAfter that you can add LD_PRELOAD=game.so to the game launch options.\n\n"
