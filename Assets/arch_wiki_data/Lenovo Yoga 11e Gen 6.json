The key is visible to xev and similar tools.\n1. The physical key has a symbol on it, which describes its function.\n1. xev only returns a KeymapNotify event, but no KeyPress or KeyRelease events. No keycodes are seen by xev.\n1. Unlike some models, Fn+F8 does *not* send an XF86RFKill keypress event. However, it should be possible to bind this to rfkill to achive the same result.\n\nThe following xbindkeys configuration may be needed to get volume/mic controls working properly:\n\n```\n\"pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle\"\n    m:0x0 + c:121\n    XF86AudioMute\n\"pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%\"\n    m:0x0 + c:123\n    XF86AudioRaiseVolume\n\"pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -5%\"\n    m:0x0 + c:122\n    XF86AudioLowerVolume\n\"pactl set-source-mute @DEFAULT_SOURCE@ toggle\"\n    m:0x0 + c:198\n    XF86AudioMicMute\n```\n\n"
