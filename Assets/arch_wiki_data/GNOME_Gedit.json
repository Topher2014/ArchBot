The backup file's name will be the same as original file's name but suffixed with a ~ symbol. Hence, for the file called file1 the backup copy would have the name file1~. Backup files are hidden by default.\n\nTo enable this behaviour, access gedit's Preferences panel (for GNOME Shell users, this can be found in gedit's global menu). In the preferences panel, click on the Editor tab and tick the option Create a backup copy of files before saving.\n\n"
