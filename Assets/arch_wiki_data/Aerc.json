      "content": "aerc is a terminal-based e-mail client with Vim-style keybindings and an ex-command system. It uses an embedded teminal which allows to use any terminal-editor as an embedded component to compose e-mails. aerc comes with inbuilt support for IMAP and SMTP, but also supports Maildir and Notmuch. While aerc provides a simple wizard to set up an e-mail account, the complete configuration is handled in text files within $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aerc.\n\naerc is written in Go and uses the Tcell package for the terminal UI.\n\n"
