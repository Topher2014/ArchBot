It offers significantly faster writes to ntfs filesystems than the default ntfs-3g driver. This document will describe how to setup ufsd to work on your computer.\n\nSince 2020-08-14, Paragon has worked to upstream their driver directly into the mainline Linux kernel. Their proprietary driver remains available. See NTFS.\n\n"
