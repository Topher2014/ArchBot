It may take a few seconds before the shell successfully restarts. On X11, restarting the shell in this fashion should not log the user out, but it is a good idea to try and ensure that all work is saved anyway; on Wayland (currently the default), restarting the shell kills the whole session, so everything will be lost.\n\nIf this fails, the Xorg server will need to be restarted either by pkill X for console logins or by restarting gdm.service for GDM logins. Bear in mind that restarting the Xorg server will log the user out, so try to ensure that all work is saved before attempting this.\n\n"

See the method below.\n\nLocate the folder where your extensions are installed. It might be ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions or /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.\n\nEdit each occurrence of metadata.json which appears in each extension sub-folder.\n\nTable content:\nInsert: | \"shell-version\": [\"3.x\"]\nInstead of (for example): | \"shell-version\": [\"3.4\"]\n\n\"3.x\" indicates the extension works with every shell version.
