      "content": "The Core Ultra Series 1 can be configured with one of two different displays.\n\nThe default 2256x1504 resolution display has 400nit brightness and 60Hz refresh rate. The matte display module is manufactured by BOE and is uncalibrated from factory, giving a suboptimal default sRGB coverage. It is thus recommended to apply this ICC profile if you have this display in order to have better color reproduction.\n\nThe newer 2880x1920 resolution display, better known as the 2.8k display module has 30-120Hz variable refresh rate and 10-bit color support. This display can be identified by the rounded top corners. The 2.8k display resolution at 256 DPI is perfect for 2x scaling factor as many desktop environments under Linux currently struggle with fractional scaling. This ICC profile is available to improve color reproduction.\n\n"

      "content": "By default, the speakers do not sound very balanced due to the downward firing speakers, so you may want to use an equalizer to fix this. The recommended method is to install EasyEffects and use the official preset found here.\n\nAlternatively, you can use user-created profiles such as this one created by cab404.\n\n"
