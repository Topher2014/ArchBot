This might be related to a known issue on the Lenovo forum that Lenovo is currently investigating as of December 2023. Toggling the card with rfkill (or Fn+F8) seems to solve the problem when it occurs.\n\nAnother option is to disable power save for the card\n\n```\n# iw dev wlp1s0 set power_save off\n```\n\nA more permanent solution can be found at Power management#Network interfaces - replace on with off.\n\n"
