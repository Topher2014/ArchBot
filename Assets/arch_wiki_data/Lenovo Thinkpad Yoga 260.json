On Linux you can workaround by disabling whatever device is interrupting excessively.\n\nFind the interrupting source:\n\n```\n$ grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts\n```\n\nThis might output something like this:\n\n```\n...\n/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe34:   30289   enabled  <-- this causes many interrupts\n/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe35:       3   enabled\n...\n```\n\nDisable it:\n\n```\n# echo \"disable\" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe34\n```\n\nNow the CPU should idle at 0-2% usage.\n\nUnfortunately you have to do that on every startup. A systemd service can do that automatically for you.\n\nCreate /etc/systemd/system/disable-interrupts.service:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Disable acpi interrupts\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -c 'echo \"disable\" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe34'\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nThen enable the disable-interrupts.service systemd unit.\n\n"
