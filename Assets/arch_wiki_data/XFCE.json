This lets you configure modifier keys to act as other keys when pressed and released on their own.\n\nNext, go to Settings > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts and assign an unused key combination, say Alt+F1, to the Application menu (or whatever action you want when you press the Super key by itself). Test that it works. Next, use xcape to assign Alt+F1 to the Super key:\n\n```\n$ xcape -e 'Super_L=Alt_L|F1'\n```\n\nCheck that the Super key now performs the action you assigned to Alt+F1.\n\nIf all is well, make this an autostart action; go to Settings > Session and Startup > Application Autostart tab, press the Add button and enter the command there to make it run every time you start Xfce (if xcape was already installed, also check that there is not already a similar entry registered).\n\nNow, you can freely use the Super key in shortcuts.
