      "content": "For users of GNOME there is an easy way of using fuseiso from the nautilus-context menu.\n\nFirst you will need the actions-for-nautilus-gitAUR package, then you need to save the following scripts to a folder of your choice (e.g. ~/.local/bin/):\n\n```\nfilemanager-actions-iso-mount.sh\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nFILE=$(basename \"$1\")\nMOUNTPOINT=\"$HOME/Desktop/$FILE\"\n\nfuseiso -p \"$1\" \"$MOUNTPOINT\"\n```\n\n```\nfilemanager-actions-iso-umount.sh\n```\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nFILE=$(basename \"$1\")\nMOUNTPOINT=\"$HOME/Desktop/$FILE\"\n\nfusermount -u \"$MOUNTPOINT\"\n```\n\nMake them executable. Now, start Actions for Nautilus.\n\nAdd a new action with the following settings:\n\n- On the Basic tab: Label for the command: Mount ISO Command line to execute: /path_to_scripts/filemanager-actions-iso-mount.sh %F Current working directory: %d\n- On the Path patterns tab, add each of the following patterns: *.iso *.nrg *.bin *.img *.mdf\n\n- Label for the command: Mount ISO\n- Command line to execute: /path_to_scripts/filemanager-actions-iso-mount.sh %F\n- Current working directory: %d\n\n- *.iso\n- *.nrg\n- *.bin\n- *.img\n- *.mdf\n\nWith this action you can mount ISO-images to your Desktop. It will create a folder in ~/Desktop with the name of the iso. fuseiso will mount the iso to this folder.\n\nAnd a second one:\n\n- On the Basic tab: Label for the command: Unmount ISO Command line to execute: /path_to_scripts/filemanager-actions-iso-umount.sh %F Current working directory: %d\n- On the Path patterns tab, add each of the following patterns: *.iso *.nrg *.bin *.img *.mdf\n\n- Label for the command: Unmount ISO\n- Command line to execute: /path_to_scripts/filemanager-actions-iso-umount.sh %F\n- Current working directory: %d\n\n- *.iso\n- *.nrg\n- *.bin\n- *.img\n- *.mdf\n\nThis second action will unmount the mounted iso and remove the folder from the desktop.\n\nSave the configuration then restart Nautilus with nautilus -q in a Terminal window.\n\nSometimes you have to logout to be able to mount any image of the given types simply by right clicking it in Files and selecting Mount ISO. To unmount it again, just right click the corresponding folder on your desktop and select Unmount ISO.\n\n"
