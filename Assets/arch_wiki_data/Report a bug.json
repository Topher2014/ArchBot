If so, an appropriate bug report may already exist. In this case, please do not create a duplicate report; see #Following up on bugs instead.\n\nSearch thoroughly for existing information, including:\n\n- Arch Linux Forums: The forums are often the first stop for users looking for help or sharing ideas. While a solution may not yet exist, additional background information and discussion can steer you in the right direction.\n- Arch Linux bug tracker: Your problem may have already been reported to Arch Linux developers. Duplicate bug reports are unhelpful and promptly closed. Search both closed bugs as well as open reports by choosing 'All Statuses' under Advanced. Remember to mark 'search details' and/or 'search comments' under Advanced, the bug title may not contain the text you are searching for.\n- Google or your favorite search engine: Search using the program's name, version, and a relevant part of the error message, if any.\n- Upstream forum, mailing list and bug tracker: If Arch Linux is not responsible for a bug, it should be reported upstream rather than the Arch Linux bug tracker. Search both recently closed bugs as well as open reports. Bugs may have already been fixed in the program's development version.\n- Other distribution forums: The free software community is vast; Archers are not the only users with ideas! Consider searching the Gentoo Forums, FedoraForum.org, and Ubuntu Forums, for example.\n\n"

      "title": "Upstream or Arch?",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Arch Linux is a GNU/Linux distribution. Arch developers and Package Maintainers are responsible for compiling, packaging, and distributing software from a wide range of sources. Upstream refers to these sources â€“ the original authors or maintainers of software that is distributed in Arch Linux. For example, the popular Firefox web browser is developed by the Mozilla Project.\n\nIf Arch is not responsible for a bug, the problem will not be solved by reporting the bug to Arch developers. Responsibility for a bug is said to lie upstream when it is not caused through the distribution's porting and integration efforts.\n\nBy reporting bugs upstream, you will not only help Archers and Arch developers, but you will also help other people in the free software community as the solution will trickle down to all distributions.\n\nOnce you have reported a bug upstream or have found other relevant information from upstream, it might be helpful to post this in the Arch bug tracker, so both Arch developers and users are made aware of it.\n\nSo what is Arch Linux responsible for?\n\n- Arch Linux Projects: pacman, AUR, mkinitcpio, Arch Websites. If you have a doubt about if the project belongs to Arch or not, display the package information (pacman -Qi package_name or using the website) and look at the upstream URL. Note: Report issues for Arch Linux software projects in the project's upstream issue tracker on gitlab.archlinux.org or GitHub instead of the respective package issues.\n- Packaging: Packaging basically consists of fetching the source code from upstream, compiling it with relevant options, making sure that it will be correctly installed on an Arch system, and checking that the main functionality works. Packaging at Arch does not consist of adding new functionality or patches for existing bugs; this is the job of the upstream developer.\n\nIf a bug/feature is not under Arch's responsibility, report it upstream. See also #Reasons for not being a bug.\n\n"

Use the Flag Package Out-of-Date feature on Arch's packages website.\n- A package which does not use Fedora, Ubuntu or some other community patch. Patches should be submitted upstream.\n- A package where non essential function X or function Y is not activated. This is a feature request.\n- A package which does not include a .desktop file or icons or other freedesktop stuff. This is not a bug if such files are not included in the source tarball, and this must be requested as a feature request upstream. If such files are provided by upstream but not used in the package then this is a bug.\n\n"

      "title": "Gather useful information",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Here is a list of useful information that should be mentioned in your bug report:\n\n- Version of the package being used. Always specify package version. Saying \"the latest\", \"todays\", or \"the package in extra\" have absolutely no meaning. Especially if the bug is not about to get fixed right away.\n- Version of the main libraries used by the package (available in the depends variable in the PKGBUILD), when they are involved in the problem. If you do not know exactly what information to provide then wait for a bug hunter to ask you for it...\n- Version of the kernel used if you are having hardware related problems.\n- Indicate whether or not the functionality worked at one time or not. If so, indicate since when it stopped working.\n- Indicate your hardware brand when you are having hardware related problems\n- Add relevant log information when any is available. This can be obtained in the following places depending on the problem: The systemd journal. If using syslog-ng, /var/log/messages contains logs related to kernel and hardware related issues. ~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log or /var/log/Xorg.0.log or /var/log/Xorg.2.log or any Xorg like log files if video related problems (nvidia, ati, xorg...) Run your program in a console and use verbose and/or debug mode if available (see your program documentation), and copy the output in a file. When running an application in a terminal make sure relevant information will be displayed in English so that many people can understand it. This can be done by using export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8. Example with a software named foobar from which you would like to have relevant information at runtime and provided that foobar has a --verbose option: $ export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 $ foobar --verbose This will affect only the current terminal and will stop taking effect when the terminal is closed.\n\n- The systemd journal.

Attaching a file rather than using a pastebin to present relevant information is preferable in general due to the fact that pastebined content may suffer by expired links or any other potential problems. Attaching a file guarantees the provided information will always be available.\n\n- Indicate how to reproduce the bug. This is very important, it will help people test the bug and potential patches on their own computer.\n- The stack trace. It is a list of calls made by the program during its execution, and helps in finding part of the program where the bug is located, especially if bug involves the program crashing. You can obtain a stack trace using gdb (The GNU Debugger) as explained in Debugging/Getting traces#Getting the trace.\n\n"

It is usually the case when more investigation is needed to determine which software is responsible for the bug.\n- Assigned - The bug has been assigned to a developer responsible for the software involved in the bug. It does not mean that the developer will be the one who will fix the bug. It does not even mean that the developer will work on a solution. It just means that the developer will take care of the life cycle of the bug, including reviewing patches if any, releasing a fix and closing the bug when required. It is unwise to contact a developer directly and to ask them to fix it more quickly; they will certainly not like this.\n- Researching - Somebody is looking for a solution. This status is rarely used at Arch, for good reason. The researching status could make people believe they do not need to get interested in the bug report. But usually we need more than one person to fix a bug: having several experienced people on a bug helps a lot.\n- Waiting on Response and Requires testing - The one who reported a bug has been asked to provide more information or to try a proposed solution, but they did not reply yet. These statuses are rarely used at Arch, but should be used more often. Still, it is important that you watch the bug (see #Voting and Watching), as developers or bug hunters usually ask questions in the comments.\n- A task closure has been requested - This is not exactly a status, but you may find some bug reports with such a notification. This indicates that somebody requested a closure for the bug. A reason is added to the request most of the time. It is upon the assignee developer to decide whether they will accept the closure or not.\n- Closed - Either this is not a valid bug (see #Reasons for not being a bug) or a solution has been found and released.\n\nThe Bug Wranglers are responsible for dispatching bugs and setting their status together with the help of the respective maintainers of the package the bug was opened against.\n\n"
