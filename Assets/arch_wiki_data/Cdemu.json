      "content": "CDemu is a software suite designed to emulate an optical drive and disc (including CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs). It enables you to use other disk image formats that contain more than just the standard ISO-9660 filesystem, for instance .bin/.cue, .nrg, or .ccd images. mount can directly handle only .iso disc images (which contain a single filesystem), but many images contain multiple sessions, mixed data/audio tracksâ€¦ In short, cdemu enables you to mount nearly any kind of image file with ease.\n\n"

      "content": "CDemu can be installed with the package cdemu-client. This package pulls cdemu-daemon as its dependency, which provides a cdemu-daemon.service that can be enabled and started. Mind this is a user service. If you are using a custom kernel, instead of the normal vhba kernel module package (vhba-module) you must use the DKMS variant of the package: vhba-module-dkms.\n\nSince systemd does not automatically load drivers for CD/DVD drives, you need to do it manually:\n\n```\n# modprobe -a sg sr_mod vhba\n```\n\n"
