You are now able to enter the BIOS and disable Secure Boot. After that, save your settings and shutdown the machine once more. After pressing the small button again, you may enter the boot menu and choose your USB installation medium.\n\nYou are probably greeted now by complete darkness, press F12 a few times to brighten up your screen.\n\n"

If not, it may happen that your NVIDIA card runs at all times! If that's the case your device will get a lot hotter and louder than in normal operation.\n\nCheck if your card is on or off with cat /proc/acpi/bbswitch\n\nFor general power management and if you do not want to tweak every setting yourself, install and enable TLP.\n\nDO NOT install laptop-mode, cpupower, or any other power-management tools in addition to tlp. cpupower may even break p-state (powersaving) of your Haswell CPU, modern CPUs know how to handle themselves.\n\n"
