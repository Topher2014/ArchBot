      "content": "Bitlbee is a \"console-based IRC to IM chatting gateway\". It allows the user to interact with popular chat networks such as XMPP/Jabber, Yahoo! Messenger, the Twitter microblogging network (plus all other Twitter API compatible services like identi.ca and status.net), and social networking chat networks like Facebook and StudiVZ within their IRC client.\n\nThe users' buddies appear as normal IRC users in a channel and conversations use the private message facility of IRC.\n\n"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "It is recommended to run the Bitlbee daemon without root permission. Uncomment the following line so Bitlbee can run as the \"bitlbee\" user, which was created when the package was installed.\n\n```\nUser = bitlbee\n```\n\nFor daemon mode uncomment the following lines.\n\n```\nDaemonInterface = 0.0.0.0\nDaemonPort = 6667\n```\n\nTo only allow connections from localhost set the listen interface (DaemonInterface) to loopback.\n\n```\nDaemonInterface = 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nEnsure that the configuration directory is writeable with the user you configured:\n\n```\n# chown -R bitlbee:bitlbee /var/lib/bitlbee\n```\n\nBy default the bitlbee service doesn't kill child processes when stopping/restarting, to avoid disconnecting clients. This is desirable for public servers but less desirable in private installations where the client is left running on an old version after a upgrade.\n\nTo properly terminate bitlbee processes, edit the unit:\n\n```\nbitlbee.service\n```\n\n```\n[Service]\nKillMode=control-group\n```\n\nThen enable/start the bitlbee.service unit.\n\nNote that just starting the server does not log you into any of your chat accounts.\n\n"

You can always type help to get help.\n\nWhile in the control channel, enter:\n\n```\nhelp quickstart\n```\n\nand follow the instructions.\n\nYour friend might be requesting authorization to add you back, so just reply according to the control channel prompts.\n\nTo initiate a chat, simply open a new IRC private window:\n\n```\n/msg friend hello!\n```\n\n"
