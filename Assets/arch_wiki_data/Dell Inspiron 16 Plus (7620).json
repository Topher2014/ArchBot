This will allow Linux to detect the NVMe SSD and manage its power.\n- Disable Secure Boot. This may be re-enabled at a later point. See Secure Boot#Using a signed boot loader.\n\n"

Usually running windows own startup repair utility however fixes this issue in most cases. Another alternative is to follow this guide.\n\nThe reinstall can be done through the Dell recovery in the UEFI if needed.\n\nOnce you used the startup repair utility or have reinstalled, Windows should boot normally in AHCI mode and without error. Then one can proceed with typical dual boot setup.\n\n"

S0ix however works reasonably, losing roughly 0.5% battery per hour. \"RAID\" needs to be changed to \"AHCI\" for S0ix to work. Without S0ix activated the laptop looses around 2% battery per hour.\n\nNVIDIA's open source driver reliably disables the NVIDIA card. It is possible to use the proprietary driver, however as of August 2022 when it is used the NVIDIA GPU sometimes randomly turns on, drawing approximately 8W of extra power.\n\n"
