And though the voices lack the naturalness of the synthesizers which generate speech by combining segments of the recordings themselves, they are still very intelligible and resemble the speakers who recorded the source material.\n\nAvailable voices list you can get by command:\n\n```\n$ pacman -Ss rhvoice-voice\n```\n\nTable content:\nPackage name | Language | Note\nrhvoice-voice-hana | Albanian | \nrhvoice-voice-leticia-f123 | Portuguese | \nrhvoice-voice-alan | English | Scottish English\nrhvoice-voice-bdl | \nrhvoice-voice-clb | \nrhvoice-voice-evgeniy-eng | Evgeniy Chebatkov (StandUp comedian, voice actor)\nrhvoice-voice-lyubov | Lyubov Sablina (teacher at the language center \"Lingua Belle\")\nrhvoice-voice-slt | \nrhvoice-voice-spomenka | Esperanto | \nrhvoice-voice-natia | Georgian | \nrhvoice-voice-azamat | Kyrgyz | \nrhvoice-voice-nazgul | \nrhvoice-voice-kiko | Macedonian | Developed by LouderPages\nrhvoice-voice-suze | Developed by Branislav Gerazov\nrhvoice-voice-magda | Polish | \nrhvoice-voice-natan | \nrhvoice-voice-aleksandr | Russian | Aleksandr Karlov (TV and radio host, audiobook reader).The current version of the HQ voice has a higher quality than the previous version, their sound is different, so the new version is temporarily separated into a separate voice to collect feedback.
