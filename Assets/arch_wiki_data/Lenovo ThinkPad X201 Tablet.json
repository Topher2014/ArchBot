The only option is either coreboot or a custom BIOS with the whitelist \"disabled\".\n\nSuch a bios can be found at this forum post at mydigitallife.info.\n\nYou can either use Windows to flash, or a DOS boot disk with phlash16.exe and the 02C2100.ROM from the forum post's rar like I did. To do it this way, first upgrade the BIOS to the latest version from Lenovo. Then, rename \"02C2100.ROM\" to \"BIOS.WPH\", save it to your DOS boot disk and run phlash16.exe.\n\n"
