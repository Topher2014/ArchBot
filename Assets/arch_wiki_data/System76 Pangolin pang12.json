The BIOS is hard-coded to attempt to boot this on Space, and this recovery partition can be a handy way to get out of a tight spot if something should happen that renders your Arch install unbootable.\n\nSystem76 automatically updates this recovery partition from within Pop!_OS; at present, it is not known how to update it from within Arch Linux.\n\nIt may be possible to replace the contents of this recovery partition with any LiveCD you want, but as of now it is not known if anyone has tried.\n\n"
