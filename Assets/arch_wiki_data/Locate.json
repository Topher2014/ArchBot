It offers speed improvements over the find tool by searching a pre-constructed database file, rather than the filesystem directly. The downside of this approach is that changes made since the construction of the database file cannot be detected by locate. This problem can be minimised by scheduled database updates.\n\nOver time, alternative implementations have replaced each others, from slocate (secure locate) that only showed files accessible to the user, to mlocate (merging locate) that merges databases at each update, which offers a performance speedup since it can skip previously examined files to today's plocate (posting locate) is a locate based on posting lists, consuming the database ahead-of-time and making a much faster (and smaller) index out of it.\n\n"

Start it manually if you want to use it before reboot. You can also manually run updatedb as root at any time.\n\nTo save time, updatedb can be (and by default is) configured to ignore certain filesystems and paths by editing /etc/updatedb.conf. updatedb.conf(5) describes the semantics of this file. It is worth noting that among the paths ignored in the default configuration (PRUNEPATHS) are /media and /mnt, so locate may not discover files on external devices.\n\n"

If you need to exclude these mountpoints, the PRUNEPATHS setting in the same configuration file can be used.\n\n"
