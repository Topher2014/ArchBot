      "content": "The Sentelic Touchpad drivers have been added to the 3.2 kernel, so it should work out of the box by now. Since 3.4 this supports scrolling and multi-touch features. (In case of problems with the touchpad after resume see Suspend to RAM.) However it seems that two finger tapping and two finger scrolling are incompatible. To have both working you must use one of the following two patches.\n\nReubenBond has made contact with a sentelic representative who has provided him with official documentation on putting the device into absolute positioning mode. The latter can be accessed here: https://sourceforge.net/p/fsp-lnxdrv/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/fsp_packet.txt\n\nThis looks very promising and ReubenBond is committed to developing a driver in the next few weeks. This is all referenced in the forum https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125262&p=2\n\nSaaros's driver works well for two finger and side scrolling and is fairly straight forward to apply and build. Unfortunately however, it does slightly impede normal functionality, pointing does not seem quite as accurate, tapping does not seem quite as sensitive and tapping and dragging/selecting can be quite tricky. This code should eventually be accepted into the official kernel: https://github.com/saaros/sentelic/issues/2.\n\n"

Consider using an alternative such as netctl. Some users experience connection drops when using wireless. For some users this can be fixed by setting the wireless connection's BSSID (usually the router's MAC address). This only works if your wireless connection only has one access point as the BSSID is unique for each access point.\n\nAn alternative solution is to disable the ath9k driver ani feature, to do this use the following : echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/disable_ani\n\n"
