      "content": "The clickpad that is used is from Alps. Specifically, it uses Alps protocol 8 which has initial support in kernel 4.1. While basic functionality works with kernels less than 4.1, there may be issues that occur with use in kernel less than 4.1.\n\nThere are two input drivers you can use for touchpad support: synaptics or libinput\n\nUsing the synaptics driver,for more advance features such as Vertical Edge Scrolling, see Touchpad Synaptics. An interesting quirk that occurs is that in order to be able to use Vertical, or Horizontal, Edge Scrolling you have to enable Two Finger Scrolling. Setting only the Edge Scrolling option in xorg does not enable it.\n\nFor the libinput driver please see libinput.\n\nIssue (using the Synaptics Driver):\n\nAfter a certain amount of time used, the clickpad interrupts cease to be processed.\n\nWork-Around (Non-Permanent):\n\nReload the \"psmouse\" kernel module when functionality ceases. Eventually it will cease up again requiring another reload.\n\n```\n# modprobe -r psmouse\n# modprobe psmouse\n```\n\nFix\n\nIn order to fix these problems, use the libinput driver instead of synaptics.\n\n"
