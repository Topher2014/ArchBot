This method will limit changes to your desktop environment.\n\n```\nsynclient TapButton2=0 TapButton3=0 ClickFinger2=0 ClickFinger3=0 HorizTwoFingerScroll=0 VertTwoFingerScroll=0\n```\n\ntouchegg will need to be autostarted for multitouch gestures to be activated. This can be done with touchegg & in your .xinitrc, or using the autostart/startup applications functionality of your desktop environment. ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf can then be configured as necessary.\n\n"
