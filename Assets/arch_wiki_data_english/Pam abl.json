It allows you to set a maximum number of unsuccessful login attempts within a given time period, after which a host and/or user is blacklisted. Once a host/user is blacklisted, all authentication attempts will fail even if the correct password is given. Hosts/users which stop attempting to login for a specified period of time will be removed from the blacklist.\n\n"

      "content": "As of current version (1.0), pam_abl has a problem that can affect its ability to blacklist under specific conditions.\n\nDue to the way sshd operates and the way pam modules are passed information, failure of a given attempt is not logged until either a second attempt is made or the connection is closed. This means that long as the attacker only makes one attempt per connection, and never closes any connections, no failures are ever logged.\n\nIn practice, the sshd_config settings \"MaxStartups\" (default 10) and to a lesser degree \"LoginGraceTime\" (default 120s) limit the viability of this approach, but it still could be used to squeeze out more attempts then you specify.\n\nIn the meantime, the workaround is to set \"MaxAuthTries\" to 1 (or expect that an additional \"MaxStartups\" number of attempts could be made above and beyond what you specify in your pam_abl config).\n\n"
