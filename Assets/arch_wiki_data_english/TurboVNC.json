Then configure which desktop environment to use in /usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc. For example, edit the file below as root to use KDE plasma:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc\n```\n\n```\nexec startplasma-x11\n```\n\nYou can also use any different file than /usr/bin/xstartup.turbovnc with the -xstartup FILE option of vncserver to avoid modifying the script provided by the package. Then run vncserver again to start it, you should see it binds to the port 5901. You should always wrap it in a SSH tunnel as what is done with any other VNC software(see TigerVNC#Accessing vncserver via SSH tunnels).\n\n"
