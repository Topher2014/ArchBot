A RepRap prints objects of plastic and is intended for rapid-prototyping, the printer itself is built with small plastic parts which can be printed out and replaced. This page explains how to install RepRap host software on Arch Linux and how to print 3D models. More information is available on the RepRap homepage.\n\n"

You will also find what firmware you have on that page.\n\nFollow the arduino wiki page if you have an arduino based controller. Do the Installation and Configuration steps.\n\nInstall the host software by following this guide Installing RepRap on your computer. There are alternative host software solutions which are easier to install and are described in the following sections.\n\n"
