For example, if you use an EFI boot stub, you must copy vmlinuz-linux to vmlinuz-linux.efi and then mark that file as trusted in the UEFI settings.\n\nWhenever the executable is updated, it might have to be removed from the trusted list and then re-added as trusted in the UEFI settings. It is only possible to remove all trusted entries at once, not individually.\n\nSee Secure Boot for other options.\n\n"
