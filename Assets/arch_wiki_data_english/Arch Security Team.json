A CVE is public, it is identified by a unique ID of the form CVE-YYYY-number.\n\nThey publish ASAs (Arch Linux Security Advisory) which is an Arch-specific warning disseminated to Arch users. ASAs are scheduled in the tracker for peer-review, and need two acknowledgments from team members before being published.\n\nThe Arch Linux security tracker is a platform used by the Arch Security Team to track packages, add CVEs and generate advisory text.\n\n- An Arch Linux Vulnerability Group (AVG) is a group of CVEs related to a set of packages within the same pkgbase.\n- Packages qualified for an advisory must be part of the core, extra, or multilib repository.\n\n"

      "content": "To get involved in the identification of the vulnerabilities, it is recommended to:\n\n- Follow the #archlinux-security IRC channel. It is the main communication medium for reporting and discussing CVEs, packages affected and first fixed package version.\n- In order to be warned early about new issues, one can monitor the recommended #Mailing lists for new CVEs, along with other sources if required.\n- We encourage volunteers to look over the advisories for mistakes, questions, or comments and report in the IRC channel.\n- Subscribe to the mailing lists arch-security and oss-security.\n- Committing code to the arch-security-tracker (GitHub) project is a great way to contribute to the team.\n- Derivative distributions that rely on Arch Linux package repositories are encouraged to contribute. This helps the security of all the users.\n\n"

If this is a critical security issue, a bug report must be filed immediately after flagging the package out-of-date.\n- If there is no upstream release available, a bug report must be filed including the patches for mitigation. The following information must be provided in the bug report: Description about the security issue and its impact Links to the CVE-IDs and (upstream) report If no release is available, links to the upstream patches (or attachments) that mitigate the issue\n\n- If the package has not been updated after a long delay, a bug report should be filed about the vulnerability.\n- If this is a critical security issue, a bug report must be filed immediately after flagging the package out-of-date.\n\n- Description about the security issue and its impact\n- Links to the CVE-IDs and (upstream) report\n- If no release is available, links to the upstream patches (or attachments) that mitigate the issue\n\n"

CVE are attributed by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA), and each CNA obtain CVE blocks from Mitre when needed/asked, so the CVE ID is not linked to the attribution date. The \"Date Entry Created\" field often only indicates when the CVE block was given to the CNA, nothing more.\n\n"
