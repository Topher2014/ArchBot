While the IPU7 patch series has already been posted, its merging timeline remains uncertain.\n\nIn particular, both 14-inch model and 14-inch model use the IMX471 camera sensor, which is relatively uncommon and currently lacks an available driver. Consequently, full upstream support for these components may take years to materialize.\n\nConversely, non-MIPI cameras are expected to work out of the box.\n\n"
