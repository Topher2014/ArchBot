You need to enable the combination-click:\n\n```\n# Emulate3Buttons refers to the act of pressing buttons A and D\n# simultaneously to emulate a middle-click or wheel click.\nOption \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"true\"\n```\n\nThis is sufficient to enable the default mapping of button 2, which is wheel-click. See minimal configuration.\n\nAs at May 2012, there is an issue with Gnome 3 and middle click emulation. Gnome 3 is used, for example, in Ubuntu 12.04. Gnome 3 also sets the middle click property, and defaults to \"false\". Since Gnome does its settings after Xorg, the Gnome setting overrides the xorg setting, and emulation is disabled. The Gnome setting can be changed with this command:\n\n```\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse middle-button-enabled true\n```\n\nYou only need to do this once (per user) as Gnome remembers the settings between sessions.

      "title": "Scroll modifier",
      "level": 4,
      "content": "One huge limitation for the Marble Mouse is the lack of a scroll wheel or scroll ring. This limitation is overcome by assigning a scroll modifier: a mouse button which allows the trackball to scroll. When the scroll modifier is held, the trackball scrolls. Although a scroll modifier is assigned by default (see basic function), the scroll modifier is not enabled by default. In addition to enabling the scroll modifier, you may also assign it to a different button.\n\nThe standard scroll setting defines the small button for scrolling — that is good, — but the same button has a default \"click\" action that is browser back. A better choice is middle-click. Middle-click corresponds to what you would expect from years of wheel mouse usage.\n\nPutting complaints aside (these are addressed by reassigning small buttons), you specify a button to be the scroll modifier:\n\n```\nOption \"EmulateWheel\" \"true\"\nOption \"EmulateWheelButton\" \"8\"\n\n# Button 8 is the small button on the left side, which works well for right-handed users.\n# Button 9 is the small button on the right side, which works well for left-handed users.\n# Button 2 cannot be assigned as the scroll modifier; AKA \"EmulateWheelButton\".\n```\n\nDisable horizontal scrolling\n\nA particular configuration line enables horizontal scrolling. You disable horizontal scrolling by commenting that line out.\n\n```\n# A hash mark disables a configuration line.\n\n# Option \"XAxisMapping\" \"6 7\"\n```\n\nI use both scrolling directions, but some may find this restriction helpful. You cannot disable vertical scrolling in a similar fashion — not that you would want to, anyway.\n\n"

Comments in the file remind me which lines to change. You could devise a script to make switching more automatic, if you wanted to.\n\n- With Arch Linux, I prefer a lightweight or non-existent desktop environment running the Openbox window manager.\n\nOther desktop environments may have widgets to simplify — or complicate, depending how you view it — switching between right and left. With Ubuntu 10.10, for example, you need only mark a box in the mouse control panel to effect a button switch. (You must change the configuration file to get the correct scroll modifier assignment, however. Also, Ubuntu ignores large button assignments in the configuration file; the control panel makes them unnecessary.)\n\n"
