You can also put it into your xinitrc.d to make it load automatically.\n\nAnother shorter version:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nG300ID=$( xinput --list | grep G300.*Keyboard | cut --field 2 | tr --delete \"id=\" )\n\nlet $( xinput --list-props $G300ID | grep \"Device Enabled\" | cut --field 3 ) && xinput --disable $G300ID\n```\n\n"
