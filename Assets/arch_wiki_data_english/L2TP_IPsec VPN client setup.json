See Help:Style for reference.\n\nThis article describes how to configure and use a L2TP/IPsec Virtual Private Network client on Arch Linux. It covers the installation and setup of several needed software packages. L2TP refers to the w:Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and for w:IPsec, the Openswan implementation is employed.\n\nThis guide is primarily targeted for clients connecting to a Windows Server machine, as it uses some settings that are specific to the Microsoft implementation of L2TP/IPsec. However, it is adaptable with any other common L2TP/IPsec setup. The Openswan wiki features instructions to set up a corresponding L2TP/IPSec Linux server.\n\n"

It enables NAT Traversal for if your machine is behind a NAT'ing router (most people are), and various other options that are necessary to connect correctly to the remote IPsec server. The next file contains your pre-shared key (PSK) for the server.\n\nCreate the file /etc/ipsec.secrets: It should contain the following line:\n\n```\n192.168.0.123 68.68.32.79 : PSK \"your_pre_shared_key\"\n```\n\nRemember to replace the local (192.168.0.123) and remote (68.68.32.79) IP addresses with the correct numbers for your location. The pre-shared key will be supplied by the VPN provider and will need to be placed in this file in cleartext form. You may find this file already exists and already have some data, try to back it up and create a new file only with your PSK if you will see Can't authenticate: no preshared key found for ... when enabling connection in next section. Do not forget to set proper permissions (600) for this file or you will get error message We cannot identify ourselves with either end of this connection..\n\nAdd the connection, so it is available to use:\n\n```\n# ipsec auto --add L2TP-PSK\n```\n\nAt this point the IPsec configuration is complete and we can move on to the L2TP configuration.\n\n"

A lot of these options are for interoperability with Windows Server L2TP servers. If your VPN server uses PAP authentication, replace require-mschap-v2 with require-pap.\n\nThis concludes the configuration of the applicable software suites to connect to a L2TP/IPsec server. To start the connection do the following:\n\nStart openswan.service and xl2tpd.service.\n\n```\n# ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK\n# echo \"c vpn-connection\" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control\n```\n\nAt this point the tunnel is up and you should be able to see the interface for it if you type:\n\n```\n$ ip link\n```\n\nYou should see a pppX device that represents the tunnel. Right now, nothing is going to get routed through it. You need to add some routing rules to make it work right:\n\n"

Start by adding a special route for the actual VPN server through your current gateway:\n\n```\n# ip route add 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0\n```\n\nThis will ensure that once the default gateway is changed to the ppp interface that your network stack can still find the VPN server by routing around the tunnel. If you miss this step you will lose connectivity to the Internet and the tunnel will collapse. Now add a default route that routes to the PPP remote end:\n\n```\n# ip route add default via yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy dev pppX\n```\n\nThe remote PPP end can be discovered by following the step in the previous section. Now to ensure that ALL traffic is routing through the tunnel, delete the original default route:\n\n```\n# ip route delete default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0\n```\n\nTo restore your system to the previous state, you can reboot or reverse all of the above steps.\n\nThe route creation can also be automated by placing a script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d.\n\n"

This should authenticate successfully, and from this point xl2tpd should successfully construct a tunnel between you and the remote L2TP server.\n\nSolution 2: If you see the following in your journal after running journalctl -ru xl2tpd as root:\n\n```\nvas. 03 12:31:21 myhost pppd[8922]: rcvd [LCP EchoRep id=0x0 magic=<some_or_another_hash>]\nvas. 03 12:31:21 myhost pppd[8922]: rcvd [CHAP Failure id=0x1 \"E=691 R=0 C=<some_or_another_hash> V=3 M=bad username or password\"]\nvas. 03 12:31:21 myhost pppd[8922]: MS-CHAP authentication failed: bad username or password\nvas. 03 12:31:21 myhost pppd[8922]: CHAP authentication failed\n```\n\nTry adding domain name in front of username in your options.l2tpd.client file (note the double backslash), i.e:\n\n```\n…\nname DOMAIN\\\\your_vpn_username\npassword your_password\n```\n\nIssue: cannot initiate connection with ID wildcards (kind=CK_TEMPLATE) after running ipsec auto --ad L2TP-PSK when using Openswan 3.0.0.\n\nDetermine the private IP of the VPN server in the target network behind the VPN, and add the corresponding line to /etc/ipsec.conf:\n\n```\nrightid = private IP of VPN server\n```\n\n"
