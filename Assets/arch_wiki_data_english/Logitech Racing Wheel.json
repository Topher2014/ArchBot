      "title": "Testing",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "For testing the wheel there are multiple tools that can be accessed via the command-line. One common tool is jstest which can be installed via the joyutils or the linuxconsole packages. An alternative is evtest which can be installed via the evtest package. A graphical version of jstest is available in the AUR as jstest-gtk-gitAUR.\n\nTo test the wheel with jstest simply call it with the device handler (in this case with a G29 wheel and js0):\n\n```\n$ jstest /dev/input/js0\n```\n\n```\nDriver version is 2.1.0.\nJoystick (Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel) has 6 axes (X, Y, Z, Rz, Hat0X, Hat0Y)\nand 25 buttons (Trigger, ThumbBtn, ThumbBtn2, TopBtn, TopBtn2, PinkieBtn, BaseBtn, BaseBtn2, BaseBtn3, BaseBtn4, BaseBtn5, BaseBtn6, ?, ?, ?, BtnDead, (null), (null), (null), (null), (null), (null), (null), (null), (null)).\nTesting ... (interrupt to exit)\nAxes:  0:  -923  1: 32767  2: 32767  3: 32767  4:     0  5:     0 Buttons:  0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off  4:off  5:off  6:off  7:off  8:off  9:off 10:off 11:off 12:off 13:off 14:off 15:off 16:off 17:off 18:off 19:off 20:off 21:off 22:off 23:off 24:off\n```\n\nWhenever the input is changed, jstest will print the full state of the device. In case that only events should be displayed, --event can be added as flag.\n\nWhen using evtest for testing, instead of the js0 as device handler eventX is needed, which in this case is event15 for a Formula Force GP wheel. evtest then shows the events coming from the wheel:\n\n```\n$ evtest /dev/input/event15\n```\n\n```\nInput driver version is 1.0.0\nInput device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x46d product 0xc293 version 0x100\nInput device name: \"Logitech Inc.

The wheel should start to oscillate:\n\n```\n# ffcfstress -d /dev/input/event15\n```\n\n```\nposition                   center                     force\n <-----------|****+------> <-----------|*******----> <-----------|**+-------->^C\n```\n\n"

      "content": "Logitech wheels can be configured via the oversteer tool from the oversteerAUR package. For general gamepad or joystick settings that may also apply to Logitech wheels, please refer to the Gamepad wiki page.\n\nAs of version 0.6.0, oversteer contains compatibility modes for the following wheels:\n\n- Driving Force / Formula EX\n- Driving Force Pro\n- Driving Force GT\n- G25 Racing Wheel\n- G27 Racing Wheel\n- G29 Racing Wheel\n\nBesides testing the wheel, oversteer allows to configure the following aspects of the wheels:\n\n- Steering hardware lock (in degrees)\n- Combining pedals into one axis\n- Global force feedback strength\n- Manual auto-center force\n\nAdditional settings might be enabled by installing the new-lg4ff-dkms-gitAUR device driver. Especially the steering hardware lock is useful in certain racing games such as F1 2017 and Dirt Rally to allow for a more realistic steering experience by setting the hardware lock angle to the value of the actual vehicle (e.g. 360 for F1 cars and 540 for modern rally cars).\n\n"
