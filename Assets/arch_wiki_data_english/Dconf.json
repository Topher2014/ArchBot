Traditional X applications are run through Xwayland.\n- GNOME Classic provides a \"traditional desktop experience\" (with an interface similar to GNOME 2) by using certain extensions and values. Thus, it is a customized form of GNOME Shell rather than a truly distinct mode.\n- GNOME on Xorg runs GNOME Shell using Xorg.\n\n"
