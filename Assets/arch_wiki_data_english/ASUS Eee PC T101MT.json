If you have issues with this, issue this command to fix it and optionally regenerate your boot loader configuration:\n\n```\n# setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.b=80\n```\n\nThe 80 represents the highest brightness level in hexadecimal, which can be replaced with up to FF if desired. 80 is about half, being approximately the same brightness range as Windows or GRUB.\n\nThis is not permanent, so it must be autostarted at boot.\n\n"
