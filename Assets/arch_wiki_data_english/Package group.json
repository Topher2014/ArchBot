      "content": "A meta package and a package group can be defined by the packager to denote a set of related packages. Both can allow to install or uninstall this set of packages simultaneously by using the meta package or the group name as a substitute for each individual package name. While a group is not a package, it can be installed in a similar fashion to a package, see pacman#Installing package groups and PKGBUILD#groups.\n\n"

      "title": "Difference between meta package and package group",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The difference between a meta package and a regular package is that a meta package is empty and exists purely to link related packages together via dependencies. A meta package, often (though not always) titled with the \"-meta\" suffix, provides similar functionality to a package group in that it enables multiple related packages to be installed or uninstalled simultaneously.\n\nEach solution has advantages and disadvantages:\n\nmeta package:\n\n- Meta packages can be installed just like any other package (see pacman#Installing specific packages).\n- Meta packages can be removed like any other package (see pacman#Removing packages).\n- Any new member packages will be installed when the meta package itself is updated with a new set of dependencies.\n- Users cannot choose which meta package dependencies they wish to install.\n- Users cannot remove meta package dependencies without having to uninstall the meta package itself.\n\ngroup:\n\n- Package groups will prompt users to select the packages from the group that they wish to install (see pacman#Installing package groups).\n- Users cannot uninstall a group, because they installed a list of packages. Instead, pacman -R groupname tries to remove all members of the group.\n- New group members will not be automatically installed. Instead, the command comm -23 <(pacman -Sg package_group | awk '{print $2}' | sort) <(pacman -Qq | sort) can be run to show which members of a package_group are not installed on the system.\n- Users can choose which group members they wish to install.\n- Users can uninstall group members without having to remove the entire group.\n\n"

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The most important meta package is base. It contains a minimal package set that defines a basic Arch Linux installation. It includes:\n\n- basics such as glibc and bash,\n- distribution related things such as pacman and systemd\n- POSIX tools such as core utilities, process, file and file compression utilities\n- networking tools such as iproute2\n\nThe kernel is an optional dependency. See the announcement when it was introduced, and reasoning why base is a meta package.\n\nAn other common meta package is base-devel. It contains a complete build environment for makepkg. See the reasoning why it has become a meta package.\n\n"
