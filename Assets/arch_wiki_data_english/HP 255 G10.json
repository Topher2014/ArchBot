Unloading the module and loading it again with the parameters is insufficient.\n\n```\nrtw89_pci disable_aspm_l1=Y disable_aspm_l1ss=Y\n```\n\nFailure to apply them correctly will lead to the card hard freezing and becoming unusable until the next cold boot.[1]\n\nBluetooth audio may be choppy when Wi-Fi is used simultaneously, even if only 5 GHz is used. Disable powersaving mode via a kernel module parameter to solve this[2]:\n\n```\nrtw89_core disable_ps_mode=y\n```\n\n"
