The problem is that systemd-backlight@backlight:amdgpu_bl0.service reads the value (saving it before the shutdown) from the /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/actual_brightness, which seems to be stuck at some value (249).\n\nManual adjustment could be done by by writing 0..255 to /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness (or by using, for example, brightnessctl). Reading from there produces the correct value as well.\n\nPossible workaround is to write preferred value to /var/lib/systemd/backlight/pci-0000:00:01.0:backlight:amdgpu_bl0 and make it immutable with chattr.\n\nSeems like the same issue as the one mentioned in the comment 19 of this kernel bug report.\n\n"
