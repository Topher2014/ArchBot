This can be verified with https://no-cursor.com/, taking 60 seconds to complete the test.\n\nRemoving the psmouse module seems to improve the touchpad. After this, the trackpoint and the physical touchpad buttons stop working but the touchpad becomes more usable; it now only takes 30 seconds to complete the above test.\n\nThe fix for IdeaPad 3 14IIL05 may also work.\n\nThis no longer appears to be the case; the touchpad now works out of the box.\n\n"
