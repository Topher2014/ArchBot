This is accomplished via entries in ~/.config/newsraft/config, including reader and color settings, and key bindings for both built in actions bind key action and shell commands bind key exec command, including options for opening links in designated programs. Multiple commands can be associated with a single binding by separating them with semicolons:\n\n```\n~/.config/newsraft/config\n```\n\n```\nbind f exec feh \"%l\"\nbind key action1; exec command1; action2; exec command2\n```\n\nDefault key bindings can be disabled if undesired or for repurposing with unbind key. Finally, like the feeds file, the # symbol designates comment lines and will be ignored by newsraft.\n\n"

The first is the feed URL, which can be added with a text editor one feed per line:\n\n```\n~/.config/newsraft/feeds\n```\n\n```\nhttps://example.org/feed.xml \"Lorem Ipsum Blog\"\n```\n\nOnly the URL is strictly necessary. Newsraft will attempt to name the feed based on information provided by the feed. If an alternate name is desired, this can be supplied by adding the title in enclosed double quotes separated from the URL by at least one white space.\n\nSection headers are the next type of line, which start with the @ symbol, at least one white space, and then the section name:\n\n```\n~/.config/newsraft/feeds\n```\n\n```\n@ Section Header\n```\n\nThe final type of entry in the feeds file are comments, which start with the # symbol:\n\n```\n~/.config/newsraft/feeds\n```\n\n```\n# this line is completely ignored by newsraft\n```\n\nBoth feed URLs and section headers can set auto update frequency, with individual feed frequencies overriding sectional frequencies. The period is specified by a number minutes enclosed by square brackets:\n\n```\n~/.config/newsraft/feeds\n```\n\n```\n@ Section Header [120]\nhttps://example.org/feed2.xml \"Lorem Ipsum Blog\" [60]\nhttps://example.org/feed3.xml\nhttps://example.org/feed4.xml [0]\n```\n\nSpecifying [0] will disable automatic updates and global feed updates can be specified by using the Global section header. In the above example, all feeds under Section Header are automatically updated every two hours, except feed2, which is updated every hour, and feed4, which is never automatically updated.\n\n"
