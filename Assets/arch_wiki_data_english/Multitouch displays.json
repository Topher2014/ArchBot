Now, get the MT_CLASS_* definitions from [1]. Currently vendor specific classes are available for 3M Cypress and eGalax. If none of this matches your device, you can try to experiment with the other MT_CLS_*. In this example\n\n```\n#define MT_CLS_EGALAX                           0x0103\n```\n\nYou need to convert MT_CLS_* to decimal (In this case, 0x0103 is 259 in decimal).\n\nAfter loading the hid-multitouch, see Kernel modules, you need to pass the devices' options with\n\n```\n# echo BUS VID PID MT_CLASS_* > /sys/module/hid_multitouch/drivers/hid\\:hid-multitouch/new_id\n```\n\nIn this example, the touchscreen is an USB device, so BUS=3 and the previous command looks like this:\n\n```\n# echo 3 0eef 725e 259 > /sys/module/hid_multitouch/drivers/hid\\:hid-multitouch/new_id\n```\n\nReboot. If the touchscreen is detected you should submit your devices' details (relevant lsusb line) to the linux-input mailing list.\n\nIf the touchscreen is not working properly, you may need to install a specific driver for your touchscreen, see #Drivers.\n\n"
