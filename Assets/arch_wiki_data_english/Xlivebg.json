It provides all the groundwork necessary for displaying animated graphics with OpenGL on the root window, so that a variety of live wallpapers can be written without having to deal with how to tie everything to the X window system, how to create the OpenGL context itself, or how to present any configurable parameters of the live wallpaper to the user.\n\n"
