Although it is not thin as ultrabooks, it is still very thin for a gaming laptop. As of October 5th 2017, the 2016 model works fine with the latest kernel. The 2017 model has a bug concerning the eDP LCD display. There is a fix from intel here: https://github.com/freedesktop/drm-tip/commit/0501a3b0eb01ac2209ef6fce76153e5d6b07034e.patch[dead link 2023-05-06 â“˜]\n\nThis issue was discussed in this thread: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=230541\n\n"

In order to avoid issues caused by the BIOS in the GS63VR when using bbswitch, add acpi_osi=! acpi_osi=\"Windows 2009\" to the kernel options at boot (per NVIDIA Optimus#Lockup issue (lspci hangs)).\n\nFor HDMI/DP ouput: Bumblebee#Output wired to the NVIDIA chip.\n\nAs alternative, you can use Optimus Manager. You can change between Intel and Nvidia restarting the X server and use external screen use nouveau driver.\n\n"
