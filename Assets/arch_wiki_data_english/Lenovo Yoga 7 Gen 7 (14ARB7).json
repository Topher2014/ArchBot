There is work in progress to support this with Fprint, however for now it is only unofficial and according to upstream \"should be fully functional right now\". Check #See also for more information.\n\nSomething else to consider is that due to the nature of this specific hardware, having seamless support for dualbooting with Windows is unlikely to be possible, and you have to disable the drivers in Windows if you want to use it in Linux with the unofficial work-in-progress support.\n\nTo install the driver for the 06cb:00be, follow the guide on GitHub\n\nTo install the driver for the 27c6:55b4, follow Lenovo Yoga 7i#Fingerprint reader.\n\n"
