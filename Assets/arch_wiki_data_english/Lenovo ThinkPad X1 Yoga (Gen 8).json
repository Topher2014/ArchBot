When booted into Microsoft Windows, the webcam is listed as Intel(R) ADL AVStream Camera. This camera requires using a recent kernel (version 6.3 or higher). The IPU6 module is also needed, which is provided by intel-ipu6-dkms-gitAUR. However, making it work requires several steps. This repository has the patched drivers and an installation script for Arch, which may partially work.\n\nSome products sold with Windows 11 Pro (21CD000MUS) or without an operating system (a.k.a. the \"DOS\" version 21CES1XT00) have regular USB cameras that work out of the box.\n\n"
