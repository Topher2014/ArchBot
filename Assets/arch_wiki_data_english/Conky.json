See Help:Style for reference.\n\nConky is a system monitor software for the X Window System (Wayland support is a work in progress). It is available for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. It is free software released under the terms of the GPL license. Conky is able to monitor many system variables including CPU, memory, swap, disk space, temperature, top, upload, download, system messages, and much more. It is extremely configurable, however, the configuration can be a little hard to understand. Conky is a fork of torsmo.\n\n"

There are also alternative packages you can install with extra compile options enabled:\n\n- conky-cliAUR - conky without X11 dependencies\n- conky-lua-nvAUR - with both Lua and Nvidia support\n\nSome built in variables in conky require additional packages to be installed in order to be utilized, for example mpd for music. As for hard drive temperature, see lm_sensors#S.M.A.R.T. drive temperature. From Conky's point of view, drivetemp can be used as a replacement for the hddtemp package and variable by using its hwmon variable.\n\nAdditional utility:\n\n- Conky Manager — Theme manager for Conky widgets. It provides options to start/stop, browse and edit Conky themes installed on the system.\n\n"
