Additionally you can install the packages scala-docsAUR and/or scala-sourcesAUR for further reference.\n\nSince Scala runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), you will need a fully functional Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in order to execute or compile your programs.\n\nFor scala3 (which is also known as dotty), you can install scala3AUR or scala-dottyAUR. Note that scala3 is incompatible with scala 2.13 or older.\n\n"
