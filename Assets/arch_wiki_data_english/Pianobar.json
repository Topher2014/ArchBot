This should be located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pianobar/config or ~/.config/pianobar/config\n\n```\n$ man pianobar\n```\n\n```\nCONFIGURATION\n       The  configuration file consists of simple key = value lines, each ter‚Äê\n       minated with a newline (\\n) character. Note that keys  and  values  are\n       both  case  sensitive, and there must be exactly one space on each side\n       of the equals sign.\n\n       act_* keys control pianobar's key-bindings.  Every  one-byte  character\n       except for \\x00 and the special value disabled are allowed here.\n```\n\nHere is an example configuration file. See pianobar(1) for more configuration options.\n\n```\n~/.config/pianobar/config\n```\n\n```\naudio_quality = {high, medium, low}\nautostart_station = stationid\n\npassword = plaintext_password\nuser = your@user.name\n```\n\n"
