Battery will stop charging once when it reaches values designed in /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold However, once when the designed value is reached, system will correctly report Connected, Not Charging status, but the value will be offset by 1 (e.g. 79% will be displayed instead of 80%). Unfortunately, charge treshold is automatically set to 100% on boot, this may be solved with systemd service: refer to Laptop/ASUS#Battery charge threshold\n\n"

Also, it is unresponsive to REISUB or any other keyboard shortcut in that state.\n- While powered on, CPU fan will sometimes turn on to 5000 - 6000 RPM for a few seconds, even when it is not under load, and temperatures are under 35Â°C.\n\n"
