See FS#25210, FS#15043, and FS#16394 for examples of the sorts of issues that may arise from attempting to parse shell scripts.\n\n"

Neither keys nor values are quoted. Data that, in a PKGBUILD, would be represented by an array is instead specified multiple times. For instance, the following are equivalent:\n\n```\nPKGBUILD\n```\n\n```\narch=(i686 x86_64)\n```\n\n```\n.SRCINFO\n```\n\n```\narch = i686\narch = x86_64\n```\n\nThe main section of the file is headed by a pkgbase declaration, and contains data applicable to the package as a whole. In a standard PKGBUILD describing a single package, this will be the only section, followed by a pkgname declaration containing the same value as the preceding pkgbase:\n\n```\npkgbase = foo\n\tpkgdesc = An example package.\n\t...\n\tmd5sums = SKIP\n\npkgname = foo\n```\n\nIn a split PKGBUILD, each section is headed by a pkgname, followed by any data specific to that package.\n\nNote: **This article or section needs expansion.** This article or section needs expansion.\n\nThis article or section needs expansion.\n\n"
