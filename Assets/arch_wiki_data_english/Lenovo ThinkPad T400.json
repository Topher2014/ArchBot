Attempting to play an H.264 encoded video with mpv and hardware acceleration results in the screen momentarily freezing. This may ultimately lead to a session reset which will force you back to the login screen. Session resetting seems to happen more frequently with the modesetting driver compared to the xf86-video-intel driver.\n\n"
