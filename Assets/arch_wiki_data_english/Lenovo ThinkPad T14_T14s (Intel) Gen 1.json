This is a problem that is similar to one which has been reported on some other Lenovo laptops and is likely due to a faulty firmware. If the device is stuck in a boot loop after replacing the Secure Boot keys, the only way to repair it is by replacing the mainboard of the device. Hopefully, the issue will get fixed with a firmware update in the future.\n\n"

Which makes applications stutter. So far, in a desk, using the performance mode while connected to the power supply was not a problem.\n\nFor the ThinkPad T14 Intel, the ACPI calls are as follows:\n\nTable content:\neconomy | \\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC._Q6F\nbalanced | \\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC._Q6E\nperformance | \\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC._Q6D\n\nTo enable ACPI method calls through /proc/acpi/call, install the acpi_call kernel module. Install acpi_call-lts if you are using linux-lts.\n\nThen call one of the ACPI methods above to enable a power mode. For example, run the following command to enable performance mode:\n\n```\n# echo '\\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC._Q6D' > /proc/acpi/call\n```\n\nThe result of the call can be determined by examining the contents of /proc/acpi/call. A successful call for the previous method is indicated by the following output:\n\n```\n# cat /proc/acpi/call; printf '\\n'\n```\n\n```\n0x8012b01\n```\n\nYou can check what is the throttling temperature in Celsius for the NVIDIA GPU if you want to make sure, note that you need the nvidia-settings package installed:\n\n```\n$ nvidia-settings -q GPUMaxOperatingTempThreshold\n```\n\nAn output of 87C or 75C means it is in performance mode.\n\n"

After doing that, running the command again should print 0. You should be able to see your CPU boosting way higher.\n\n"
