      "content": "Starting with version 216 of systemd, the command systemd-firstboot allows for setting of basic system settings before or during the first boot of a newly created system. The tool is able of initialize the following system settings: timezone, locale, hostname, the root password, as well as automated generation of a machine ID.\n\nAs systemd-firstboot interacts with the filesystem directly and does not make use of the related systemd services (such as timedatectl, hostnamectl or localectl), it should not be executed on an already running system.\n\nSettings can be specified non-interactively when externally used on filesystem images, or interactively if executed during the early boot process.\n\nA default Arch Linux installation will set most variables systemd-firstboot is able to manipulate, or facilitate the creation of skeleton files which prevent its use when installing the systemd package through pacstrap.\n\n"

      "content": "Allowing systemd-firstboot to manipulate a previously un-booted Arch Linux installation is particularly useful in situations where installation is undertaken by an individual other than the eventual end user, such as in the distribution of laptops with a pre-loaded install.\n\nThe following steps should be appended to the end of the Configure the system section of the Installation guide, before the target partitions are unmounted, thus taking place within the chroot of the new installation. Make sure all locales you want available have been generated, non-generated ones will not be offered as a possible setting.\n\n"
