It is based on Xlib and needs no other external libraries to compile it. It provides an initial windowing environment for minimalist desktops or for single use purposes such as:\n\n- A web browser terminal computer.\n- Testing gui based programs.\n\nPAWM was written by David Gómez and Raúl Núñez de Arenas Coronado. PAWM was written with the objective of creating a tiny window manager that would execute any X application, but still keep it simple and intuitive to use.\n\nPAWM stands for Puto Amo Window Manager.\n\n"

The name of the image you want to use.\n1. The initial icon screen position. As you move it, PAWM will edit the X Y coordinates accordingly.\n1. Icon text. This is optional.\n1. Application binary. This can be either relative or absolute path.\n\nThe finished file will look like this:\n\n```\nappSakura\n```\n\n```\nsakura.xpm\n40 40\nSakura\nsakura\n```\n\nWhen you next start PAWM your icons will be there. As well, any icon changes including position will be preserved.\n\n"
