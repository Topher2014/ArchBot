Answer the questions and modify to your needs.\n- Run faxaddmodem as the root user. It asks you for the device, leave out the /dev prefix; only enter eg. modem, ttyS0 or such things.\n- Answer the other questions, important ones could be the ringtones, max pages, permissions on files or your the name that should be shown.\n- Enable the service for the daemon. Assuming your modem is on ttyS0, the service would be faxgetty@ttyS0.service.\n- The package contains further services and systemd timers to start/enable for your usage. For example, hfaxd.service and faxq.service.\n\nYour received faxes will be saved in /var/spool/hylafax/rcvq/ and deleted after 30 days. Your sent faxes will be saved in /var/spool/hylafax/sendq/.\n\n"
