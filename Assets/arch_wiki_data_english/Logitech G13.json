It uses rubber dome keyswitches for the main 22-keys, mouse-like buttons for the two buttons around the joystick, a joystick (which can be pressed in), four Mode buttons, four option buttons, a menu button, and a backlight toggle.\n\nThere are a couple options for drivers, but only one that appears to work well today:\n\n- Running the official Logitech Gaming Software under Wine. Despite working fine, the software has a Garbage rating on WineHQ, as it cannot actually communicate with USB devices. (However, the reports available are quite old, and you may have better luck)\n- g15daemonAUR, despite its backend (libg15) claiming to support the G13, does not actually support the G13.\n- linux-g13-driver, which can compile if you edit the Makefile (see issue #16), and may work for you.\n- g13 g13-gitAUR is a user-space driver, which seems to work the best out of these.\n\n"

      "content": "Install g13-gitAUR.\n\nThis will install the g13d daemon, the pbm2lpbm bitmap converter and a systemd service that runs g13d as user/group g13. It will also set up rules for udev to identify your G13 device, but the automatic starting and stopping of the service by connecting or unplugging is disabled by default.\n\n- To enable the systemd service and have g13d start and stop automatically upon hotplug, you will need to uncomment the two bottom lines in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/91-g13.rules\n- You will also need to uncomment the uinput line in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/91-g13.rules, which will set owner and permissions for /dev/uinput on boot, followed by a reboot.\n\n"

      "content": "g13d is configured in one of two ways, either by writing commands to /run/g13d/g13-0, or preferably by specifying keybindings and commands in a configuration file which is read at launch.\n\nWhen running g13d manually you can specify a configuration file using the --config parameter, and when running as a service the file /etc/g13/default.bind will be used.\n\nManual commands can also be evoked one at a time by manually writing to /run/g13d/g13-0:\n\nFor example, to set the display a purple colour:\n\n```\n$ echo \"rgb 177 13 201\" > /run/g13d/g13-0\n```\n\ng13 can also handle multiple commands at once:\n\n```\n$ echo -e \"rgb 177 13 201\\nbind G4 KEY_W\" > /run/g13d/g13-0\n```\n\n"
