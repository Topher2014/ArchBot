      "level": 2,
      "content": "PowerShell has a built-in remote management system via the PSSession cmdlets. This system can run over SSH. In order to configure a Linux SSH host for this, the sshd_config file needs the following line added:\n\n```\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n\n```\nSubsystem powershell /usr/bin/pwsh -sshs\n```\n\nIt is then possible to use the New-PSSession, Enter-PSSession and Invoke-Command cmdlets to control the host. This can also be done from Linux to Windows or vice versa. For an usage example, see the Microsoft documentation.\n\n"
