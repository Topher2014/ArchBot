The additional speakers can be enabled using hdajackretask from the alsa-tools package. To accomplish this, with the Realtek ALC295 codec selected, override pin 0x14 to Internal Speaker (LFE) and pin 0x1e to Internal Speaker. The option to show unconnected pins may need to be selected.\n\nMore information at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189331\n\n"

The button should now work and allow feedback of the mute state to Gnome, however the LED within the mute button does not illuminate.\n\n```\noptions snd-hda-intel model=hp-led-gpio\n```\n\n"
