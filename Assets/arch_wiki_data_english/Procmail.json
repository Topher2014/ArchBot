It can be used to filter out spam, checking for viruses, to send automatic replies, etc.\n\nThe goal of this article is to teach the configuration of procmail. This article assumes you already have either a email client (Mutt, nmh, etc) or a mail server (Sendmail, Postfix, etc) working, that can use (or requires) procmail. It also assumes you have at least basic knowledge on regular expressions. This article will give only a minimal explanation, for a complete manual, check the procmailrc(5).\n\n"

A lockfile is necessary to prevent problems if 2 or more instances of procmail are working at the same time (that may happen if 2 or more email arrive almost at the same moment).\n\nYou can set the name of the lockfile after the :\n\n"

For example:\n\n```\n| /usr/bin/vendor_perl/spamc\n```\n\nBy default, once a recipe's action is done, the processing is over.\n\nIf the f flag was used, the command can alter the message and keep reading recipes.
