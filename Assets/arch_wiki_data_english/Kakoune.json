It is inspired by Vim and similar alternatives, but tries to improve the text editing workflow as well as fit better to the Unix philosophy. Besides modal editing, two other main concepts are selection based editing, and multi-cursor editing. It has an interactive help system, and supports many languages. Kakoune inspired editors like Helix.\n\n"

If this directory exists in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, Kakoune does not load the system wide autoload dir (located at /usr/share/kak/autoload), so it has to be linked there. For example:\n\n```\n$ ln -s /usr/share/kak/autoload $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak/autoload/default\n```\n\n"
