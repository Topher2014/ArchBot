An alternative solution to saving power would be using hibernation and then focusing on improving the boot time to bring wakeup from hibernation closer to wakeup from suspend times.\n\n"

You then need to modify the dsdt.dsl file.\n\nFind the section which begins with DefinitionBlock (\"\", \"DSDT\", 2, \"HPQOEM\", \"863E \", and increment the final number (remember to increment it as hex).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nDefinitionBlock (\"\", \"DSDT\", 2, \"HPQOEM\", \"863E    \", 0x01072009)\n```\n\nShould be changed to\n\n```\nDefinitionBlock (\"\", \"DSDT\", 2, \"HPQOEM\", \"863E    \", 0x0107200a)\n```\n\nThen the definition for S3 System State needs to be added between the sections for // _S0_: S0 System State and // _S4_: S4 System State. This should end up as follows:\n\n```\nName (_S0, Package (0x04)  // _S0_: S0 System State\n    {\n        Zero, \n        Zero, \n        Zero, \n        Zero\n    })\n    Name (_S3, Package(0x04) //  _S3_: S3 System State\n    {\n        0x03,\n        0x03,\n        Zero,\n        Zero\n    })\n    Name (_S4, Package (0x04)  // _S4_: S4 System State\n    {\n        0x06, \n        Zero, \n        Zero, \n        Zero\n    })\n```\n\nYou then need to recompile the DSDT tables and create a cpio override archive, as explained in DSDT#Using modified code.\n\n"
