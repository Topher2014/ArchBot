It is a free and open source, community-developed project. Dolphin was the first GameCube and Wii emulator, and currently the only one capable of playing commercial games.\n\n"

The CPU emulation engine should be left as JIT Recompiler. Only check \"Force console as NTSC-J\" if intending to play imported Japanese discs.\n\nAll options on the \"Interface\" tab are personal choices.\n\nThe Audio tab is the DSP section's screen; setting it up now means there will be no need to do it later. See #DSP section.\n\nThe next two tabs are not very important; the GameCube tab has settings about connected accessories, such as memory cards, and the only remarkable Wii tab option is the \"Aspect Ratio\" drop-down list. Set it to either 16:9 or 4:3, depending on the display's aspect ratio.\n\nOn the final tab, \"Paths\", ISO directories can be set. The directory of game ISOs can also be set by clicking browse from the home screen, but here more options are available, such as Search Subfolders.\n\n"

Set the \"Display\" and \"Other\" settings to the desired configuration. V-sync is useful, but it can lead to slowdowns. The \"render to main window\" option improves the experience aesthetically.\n\nIf your graphics card supports Vulkan, using the Vulkan backend may give you higher performance than OpenGL. Note that the Vulkan backend might not be compatible with certain titles, so if you run into issues with a game, try switching back to OpenGL before giving up. The official compatibility list often has hints about how each renderer handles a title.\n\nOn the \"Enhancements\" tab are the options that can improve graphics. While they result to great output, they can slow the emulation down to the point of making games unplayable. Choose the best settings possible, as long as speed remains 100%.\n\nTable content:\nOption | Performance | Quality\nInternal resolution | 1x Native | Auto (Window size)\nAnti-aliasing | None | at least 2x\nAnisotropic filtering | 1x | at least 2x\nPost-Processing Effect | (off) | your choice(see tip below)\nScaled EFB copy | unchecked | checked\nPer-Pixel Lightning | unchecked | checked\nForce texture filtering,Widescreen Hack,Disable fog | off | your option(recommended: off)\n\nNote: **necessary** \n\nUnless sure, the Hacks tab is best left untouched.\n\nTable content:\nOption | Value\nSkip EFB access from CPU | unchecked\nIgnore format changes | checked\nEFB copies | texture\nTexture cache/ Accuracy | Fast\nExternal frame buffer | disable\nCache display lists | unchecked\nDisable destination alpha | unchecked\nOpenCL texture decoder | unchecked\nOpenMP texture decoder | unchecked\nFast depth calculation | checked(Should uncheck for anaglyph 3D)\nVertex streaming hack | unchecked\n\nSimilarly, unless sure, leave everything in the Advanced tab unchecked.\n\n"

Too slow.\n\nDSP LLE on separate thread improves speed on computers with multi-core CPUs, but might cause audio glitches, and is known to break Zelda ucode games. Audio backend is best set to ALSA. For pulseaudio, Dolphin's optional dependency PulseAudio needs to be installed.\n\n"

      "title": "Games frequently stutter on first playthrough, but subsequent runs are smooth",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "This stutter is likely introduced because graphics rendering has to pause due to shader compilation. Dolphin has gained advanced techniques for minimizing such stutter, called Ubershaders. They require strong GPUs to work best and thus are not enabled by default. In the graphics configuration dialog under \"Shader Compilation\", try one of the options \"Synchronous (Ubershaders)\" or \"Asynchronous (Ubershaders)\". Hover over the radio buttons to see a more detailed explanation text in the dialog. Using the option \"Compile Shaders Before Starting\" may also reduce stutter, but at the cost of a longer delay before the game starts.\n\nSee also: Improving performance â€“ most of the advice should be helpful.\n\n"
