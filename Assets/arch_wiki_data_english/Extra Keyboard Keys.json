If you have very recent or uncommon piece of hardware, you may need to adjust the mapping manually.\n\n"

To disable N-key rollover, hold down the FN lock key (next to right-ctrl) until it lights up, then hold Escape and press 6 to switch to 6-key rollover. Hold down the FN lock key to disable the Fn lock.\n\nThe Win-Lock Key completely disables the Super (Windows) keys. Simply press the FN lock key and F12 together to toggle Win-Lock on and off.\n\n"
