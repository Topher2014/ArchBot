      "content": "As of the 11th of February 2019 there is no known way to charge and have other peripherals attached to OTG at the same time for this particular tablet. This means your tablet will run off battery for the entire length of install time.\n\nThis device has a UEFI bootloader and BIOS settings menu but no keyboard included. In order to complete setup you will need a USB Hub, a wired USB keyboard, and a Micro-B OTG (On The Go) cable. Once fully set up you should be able to use the tablet without any extra peripherals.\n\nBefore starting, have your tablet in a powered off state, plug in your OTG cable, USB hub, your keyboard, and the USB storage device with your install media on.\n\nPower on your tablet and at the moment you see the \"Nuvision\" boot logo press and hold down the ESC key on your keyboard until you have reached the BIOS menu. Or alternatively push the power button and hold the volume down button on the side.\n\nIn the BIOS menu navigate right to the 'save & exit' section with the arrow keys. Under 'save & exit' navigate down and under 'boot overrides' find your USB device. Press Enter to select and boot into the storage device.\n\nAt this point your tablet should boot into the Arch Linux install environment. You may continue with the standard installation guide.\n\n"

This delays the system long enough in finding the correct display driver.\n\nThe idea is that 'i915' is loaded too early into the system and 'i915' tries to obtain control over parts of the system that have not fully loaded yet.\n\nAs of the 11th of February 2019, this workaround appears to work fine.\n\n"

It appears 2.4GHz is only supported for Wi-Fi.\n\nIf you have any issues with connecting to wireless try this workaround. It is a settings change in the BIOS, you want to make sure 'SCC SDIO Support' is set to 'PCI Mode'.\n\nTo make that change follow the below guide.\n\nFrom a powered off state, plug in a wired USB keyboard to a OTG cable and into your tablet.\n\nPower on your tablet and at the moment you see the \"Nuvision\" boot logo press and hold down the ESC key on your keyboard until you have reached the BIOS menu.\n\nIn the BIOS navigate with the arrow keys.\n\nRight to 'Chipset', down to 'South Bridge', down to 'LPSS & SCC Configuration', down to 'SCC SDIO Support' tap enter key and in the popup select 'PCI mode' and enter again.\n\nTap the ESC key to get back to the top menu and navigate to 'save & exit', then down to 'save changes and exit'.\n\nWi-Fi should behave much better after this change.\n\nAs of the 11th of February 2019, this workaround appears to work fine.\n\n"
