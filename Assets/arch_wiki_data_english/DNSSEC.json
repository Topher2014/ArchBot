See Domain name resolution#DNS servers for available options. Note that each requires specific options to enable their DNSSEC validation feature.\n\nIf you attempt to visit a site with a bogus (spoofed) IP address, the validating resolver will prevent you from receiving the invalid DNS data and your browser (or other application) will be told there is no such host. Since all DNS lookups go through the validating resolver, you do not need software that has DNSSEC support built-in when using this option.\n\n"

Additionally, some web browsers, some of them mentioned at [2], have extensions or add-ons that can be installed to implement DNSSEC without patching the program.\n\n"
