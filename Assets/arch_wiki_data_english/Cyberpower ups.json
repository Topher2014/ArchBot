      "content": "This document describes how to install the CyberPower UPS daemon PowerPanel or alternatively the Network-UPS-Tools. The main advantage of using a CyberPower UPS is that it is cheap and it can communicate with your Linux box through either a RS-232 or USB serial connection. In the event of a prolonged power outage, should the CyberPower UPS lose most of its battery capacity, it can tell the Linux box to perform a safe shutdown.\n\n"

      "content": "You can check and change the current settings using the pwrstat command. (However, the command will not work unless the daemon is up and running.)\n\nThe service performs configurable actions in two different scenarios:\n\n- When external power has failed for at least a certain amount of time (60 seconds by default)\n- When battery power is low, as determined by either of two conditions: Battery capacity is less than a predetermined percentage (35% by default), or Remaining runtime (estimated from current power draw) is less than a predetermined number of seconds (300 seconds—that is, 5 minutes—by default)\n\n- Battery capacity is less than a predetermined percentage (35% by default), or\n- Remaining runtime (estimated from current power draw) is less than a predetermined number of seconds (300 seconds—that is, 5 minutes—by default)\n\nTo check the current settings, use pwrstat -config. For example:\n\n```\n# pwrstat -config\n```\n\n```\nDaemon Configuration:\n\nAlarm .............................................. On\nHibernate .......................................... Off\n\nAction for Power Failure:\n\n\tDelay time since Power failure ............. 60 sec.\n\tRun script command ......................... On\n\tPath of script command ..................... /etc/powerpanel/pwrstatd-powerfail.sh\n\tDuration of command running ................ 0 sec.\n\tEnable shutdown system ..................... Off\n\nAction for Battery Low:\n\n\tRemaining runtime threshold ................ 300 sec.\n\tBattery capacity threshold ................. 35 %.\n\tRun script command ......................... On\n\tPath of command ............................ /etc/powerpanel/pwrstatd-lowbatt.sh\n\tDuration of command running ................ 0 sec.\n\tEnable shutdown system ..................... On\n```\n\nThe pwrstat command also provides an interface for changing the settings. For example, to configure the UPS not to shut down automatically when there is a power failure but battery power is still high:\n\n```\n# pwrstat -pwrfail -shutdown off\n```\n\nSee pwrstat(8) or the PDF user manual for more information on how to configure settings.\n\n"

For example, add the following line to either file:\n\n```\nsystemd-run --machine=target_user@.host --user notify-send \"Warning: Utility power has failed. Now running on battery.\" --icon=battery-caution\n```\n\n"
