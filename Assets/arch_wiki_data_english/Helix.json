It implements changes to the traditional Vim workflow similar to Kakoune's, like selection-based editing and multi-cursor support. Helix bundles and enables many features out of the box and does not yet have a plugin system. It does have adding custom language support. Therefore, it can be considered easier to set up but less customizable than Vim and similar editors.\n\n"
