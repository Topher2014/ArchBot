Another alternative is to follow this guide.\n\nThe reinstall can be done through the Dell recovery in the BIOS if needed.\n\nOnce you used the startup repair utility or have reinstalled, Windows should boot normally in AHCI mode and without error. Then one can proceed with typical dual boot setup.\n\n"
