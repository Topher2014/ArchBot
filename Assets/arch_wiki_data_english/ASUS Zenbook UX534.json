These models most probably share almost the same hardware (the only difference is screen size and discrete NVidia GPU, and missing Display Port Alt-Mode on some models, even 15 inch seems to not include USB-C DP Altmode -), this article covers hardware specific configuration for all ZenBook 13 (UX334), ZenBook 14 (UX434) and ZenBook 15 (UX534).\n\nHowever the first author is testing on an UX534FTC Full HD (no 4K), with NVidia GTX1650 Max-Q and a 10th generation 10510U Core I7.\n\n"

For models with discrete Nvidia graphics card, also see NVIDIA Optimus.\n\nThe Screenpad works as a secondary display and is completely separate from the touchpad: you just have a (non-touch) second screen under your fingers. Therefore it can be deactivated like any other display using one's Desktop environment settings for example, thus lowering power consumption while leaving the touchpad functionality intact.\n\nThe Screenpad requires a 'Rotation Portrait Left' and is most useful with a scale factor of 200% (Wayland allows to set a different scale factor of 100% if the main screen in only the Full HD version). If you dual boot, brightness is kept from the last Windows setting.\n\nTo change the Screenpad brightness, you can install the custom kernel module asus-wmi: https://github.com/Plippo/asus-wmi-screenpad\n\n"
