The time of inactivity before the monitor enters into a given saving power level—standby, suspend or off—can be set as described in DPMSSetTimeouts(3).\n\n"

Its syntax (where 0 disables):\n\n```\n$ setterm --blank [0-60|force|poke]\n$ setterm --powersave [on|vsync|hsync|powerdown|off]\n$ setterm --powerdown [0-60]\n```\n\n- Console blanking alone does not enable DPMS power saving. Console blanking is disabled by default. [1]\n- setterm --powerdown does not seem to have any effect when the APM_DISPLAY_BLANK kernel configuration option is not enabled. [2]\n- Console blanking can also be enabled by the consoleblank kernel parameter. See the kernel documentation for details.\n\nSome commands just write the terminal sequences to the current terminal device, whether that be in screen, a remote ssh terminal, console mode, serial consoles, etc.\n\nTo see the escape codes used, pipe the output as follows:\n\n```\n$ setterm --powerdown 2>&1 | exec cat -v 2>&1 | sed \"s/\\\\^\\\\[/\\\\\\\\033/g\"\n```\n\nTo modify a specific terminal, redirect the escape codes to it (with write permission):\n\n```\n$ setterm --powerdown 0 >> /dev/tty3\n```\n\n"

See XScreenSaver#DPMS and blanking settings and Xfce#Display blanking for more information.\n- If using the command manually in a shell you may need to prefix it with sleep 1; for it to work correctly, for example sleep 1; xset dpms force off\n- xset dpms 0 0 0, which sets all the DPMS timeouts to zero, could be a better way to \"disable\" DPMS, since the effect of -dpms would be reverted when, for example, turning off the screen with xset dpms force off.\n- If using xset in xinitrc does not work, specify settings within a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/, see #Configuration.\n\n"
