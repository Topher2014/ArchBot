This is not required for general functionality though.\n\nAdding the ConnMan Gadget to the Shelf\n\n1. Settings -> Extensions -> Modules\n1. under System\n1. Connection Manager\n1. Load that (select then hit Load).\n1. Right-click on the shelf at the bottom of the screen.\n1. Go to Shelf -> Contents\n1. Then, just scroll around and find ConnMan.\n1. and hit Add.\n\nNetworkManager\n\nYou can also use networkmanager to manage your network connections - see NetworkManager for more information.\n\nNote however that the applet will need Appindicator support to show in Enlightenment's system tray. See NetworkManager#Appindicator. As an alternative to using the applet, NetworkManager includes both CLI and TUI interfaces for network configuration - see NetworkManager#Usage.\n\n"

First, you must tell Enlightenment to autostart gnome-keyring. For that you should go to Settings Panel > Apps > Startup Applications > System and activate Certificate and Key Storage, GPG Password Agent, SSH Key Agent and \"Secret Storage Service\". After this, you should set the following:\n\n```\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/${UID}/keyring/ssh\n```\n\nThis \"hack\" is used to override the automatic setting of the variable by \"enlightenment-start\" from \"ssh-agent\" to gnome-keyring.\n\nMore information on this topic in the GNOME Keyring article.\n\n"

The scale pager effect zooms out and shows all desktops as a wall, like the compiz expo plugin. Both can be added to the desktop as a gadget or bound to a key binding, mouse binding or screen edge binding.\n\nSome people like to change the standard window selection key binding ALT + Tab to use Scale Windows to select windows. To change this setting, you navigate to Menu > Settings > Settings Panel > Input > Keys. From here, you can set any key binding you would like.\n\nTo replace the window selection key binding functionality with Scale Windows, scroll through the left panel until you find the ALT section and then find and select ALT + Tab. Then, scroll through the right panel looking for the \"Scale Windows\" section and choose either Select Next or Select Next (All) depending on whether you would like to see windows from only the current desktop or from all desktops and click Apply to save the binding.\n\nAvailable from upstream git.\n\n"

Enlightenment assumes that whatever comes after it will set the backlight to whatever it prefers, if anything as this is what Enlightenment does at start. This is especially problematic when using another desktop environment alongside Enlightenment that cannot control backlight as the backlight will not automatically be restored to its normal level when using that desktop environment. To fix this issue, open the Enlightenment Settings Panel and, under the Look tab, click on the Composite option. Tick the Don't fade backlight box and click OK.\n\n"

To do this, open the Enlightenment Settings Panel and click on the Input tab. Click on the Mouse option. Change the theme from Enlightenment to X and click OK.
