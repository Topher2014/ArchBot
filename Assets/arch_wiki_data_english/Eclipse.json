The Eclipse project is best known for its multiplatform integrated development environment (IDE). Arch Linux packages (and this guide) are specifically related to the IDE.\n\nEclipse IDE is largely written in Java, but can be used to develop applications in many languages, including Java, C / C++, PHP, Perl, Rust and Python. The IDE can also provide subversion support and task management.\n\n"
