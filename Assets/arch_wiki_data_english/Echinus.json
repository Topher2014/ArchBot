Started as a dwm fork with easier configuration, echinus became a full-featured reparenting window manager with EWMH support.\n\nUnlike dwm, echinus does not need to be re-compiled after changes have been made to the config. It supports Xft (freetype) out of the box and has the option of configurable titlebars.\n\n"
