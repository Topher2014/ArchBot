If that's the case, it means that only the amdgpu driver is gone. The rest of the system will be functional, meaning:\n\n- You can ssh to that machine\n- You can perform login and some debugging commands in blind mode, dumping their output into some files in the hard disk for posterior checks.\n\nThe solution is to disable Legacy Boot in the BIOS, so the UEFI mode will be the one used to boot. Tested with Secure Boot turned off\n\n"
