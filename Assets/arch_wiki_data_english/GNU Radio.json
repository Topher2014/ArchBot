It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\n"

      "content": "The latest stable GNU Radio version can be installed with gnuradio.\n\nBleeding edge is gnuradio-gitAUR, and in some cases VOLK may need to be built separately from libvolk-gitAUR.\n\nIf you want gnuradio-companion, just install the gnuradio-companion package which will install GNU Radio, as well as some additional required packages.\n\nAnother popular package is gnuradio-osmosdr which provides the GRC source blocks for many of the popular SDR devices (Funcube Dongle, RTL-SDR, USRP, OsmoSDR, BladeRF and HackRF).\n\n"
