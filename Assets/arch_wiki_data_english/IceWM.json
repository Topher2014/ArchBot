Although this may result in a menu filled with many unwanted applications, it may still be preferable to manually editing the menu configuration file. When running MenuMaker, use the -f flag to overwrite an existing menu file:\n\n```\n$ mmaker -f icewm\n```\n\nYou can avoid populating your menu with terminal based applications such as alsamixer(1) by running the following switches with the mmaker command: --no-legacy and --no-debian. For example:\n\n```\n$ mmaker -f --no-legacy --no-debian icewm\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can generate a menu using xdg-menu. See the xdg-menu#IceWM section.\n\n"
