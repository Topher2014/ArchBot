      "content": "There is an issue with using headphones through the 3.5mm jack when using PipeWire. When headphones are connected, little to no sound may be audible. To resolve this, adjust the Bass Speaker volume to 100% using amixer when the headphones are plugged in. After that, the regular volume control in PipeWire will function as expected.\n\n```\namixer -c 1 sset 'Bass Speaker' 100%\n```\n\nThe Bass Speaker volume must be adjusted every time headphones are connected.\n\n"

      "content": "Another issue with sound on Lenovo Yoga Pro models (specifically on 14IMH9 and 14AHP9 and 14IAP7) is sound card pin mixup. It manifests as follows: changing volume does not seem to have any effect, but when setting it to 0% volume does actually turn off. To fix volume control you need to create /etc/modprobe.d/mysound.conf with row below and reboot:\n\n```\noptions snd_sof_intel_hda_generic hda_model=alc287-yoga9-bass-spk-pin\n```\n\nThe quirk is know in linux kernel, e.g. see the constant ALC287_FIXUP_YOGA9_14IAP7_BASS_SPK_PIN in kernel realtek patches\n\nSupposedly its been fixed with kernel patch but I needed the manual modprobe option.\n\n"
