      "content": "The keyboard shortcuts in rosegarden can be customized by editing a set of XML configuration files. The first step is to download the default configuration files which are packaged with the source code, and place them in ~/.local/share/rosegarden/rc. A simple way of doing this is to run:\n\n```\n$ cd ~/.local/share/rosegarden\n$ svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/rosegarden/code/trunk/rosegarden/data/rc\n```\n\nwhich will get the configuration files from the development branch of the source code.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts can then be set or modified by editing the appropriate file in ~/.local/share/rosegarden/rc. For example, in order to map the Space bar to play/pause, edit the following lines of rosegardenmainwindow.rc:\n\n```\n~/.local/share/rosegarden/rc/rosegardenmainwindow.rc\n```\n\n```\n<Action name=\"play\" text=\"&Play\" icon=\"transport-play\" shortcut=\"Ctrl+Enter, Enter, Media Play, Ctrl+Return, Space\" shortcut-context=\"application\" />\n<Action name=\"recordtoggle\" text=\"P&unch in Record\" icon=\"transport-record\" shortcut=\"\" shortcut-context=\"application\" />\n```\n\n"
